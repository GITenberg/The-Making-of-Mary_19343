<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">A</span> sturdy</span> northeast
wind was rattling the
doors and windows of
a deserted farmhouse
in Western Michigan.
The building was not old, measured
by years, but it had never
been painted or repaired, and its
wooden face, prematurely lined
with weather stains, looked as if it
had borne the wear and tear of
centuries. The windows, like lidless
eyes, stared vacantly at the
flat stubble fields and the few
spindling trees, a dreary apology
for an orchard. There were plenty
of shingles off the roof to allow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the inquisitive rain-drops to follow
one another through the rafters,
and thence to the floor of the
room below, where the darkness
was creeping out of the corners to
take possession.</p>

<p>The house had been but recently
vacated, for there was still a
"slab" smoldering on the hearth
of the wide fireplace in the outer
kitchen, and something that
looked almost human, wrapped in
a ragged bedquilt, was lying much
too near it for safety. A friendly
gust of wind came down the chimney,
bringing back the smoke, and
drawing a faint cough from the
bundle. Another gust and
another cough, and then a sneeze
which burst open the quilt, to disclose
an ill-clad little girl, six or
seven years old.</p>

<p>She gazed about with drowsy
blue eyes till terror of the darkness
made her draw the tattered
comforter over her head again, and
crouching nearer to the smolder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>ing
log, she tried to warm her
fingers and toes. More wind
down the chimney made more
smoke, and sent the child coughing
back from the fireplace. She
was wide awake now, and stood
listening. Sounds there were,
indeed, but not one that could be
associated with any living thing
in the house. She felt her way
around the walls to where the
candle used to be, but it was gone.
There was no furniture to stumble
over, and when she came to the
side of the wall in the inner room
from which the stairway crept up,
she mounted it on her hands and
knees, trembling, partly with cold,
partly with fear at the noise made
by the flapping of the sole of one
of her old shoes. There was a
step missing at the turn of the
stairs, but the child knew where
the vacancy was, and pulling herself
over it, she reached the landing,
felt all around the walls there,
and made the circuit of the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
small rooms in the same fashion.
They were entirely empty.</p>

<p>Cautiously the girl stole down
the broken stairs and back to her
former place by the smoking slab,
where she curled herself up into
the old quilt again, as into a
mother's arms, and spoke aloud,
though there was none to listen
but the obstreperous wind:</p>

<p>"Anyhow she won't be here to
lick me no more!" That thought
seemed to compensate for darkness
and loneliness. The voices
of wind and rain were apparently
more kindly than the human tones
to which she had been accustomed,
and soothed by their stormy lullaby,
the little maid fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sunshine poured freely
into the forsaken house next
morning, drying up the damp
floors, and turning to gold the
scrap of yellow hair that showed
through a hole in the old quilt.
Presently the small girl shook
the covering away from her and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
stood up, to yawn and stretch
herself out of the stiffness from a
night spent on the hard floor.
She was not a pretty child, unless
naturally curling fair hair, that
would be fairer when it was
washed, could make her so. The
long, thin legs that came below
her torn dress made her too tall
for her age, and what might have
been a passable mouth was spoiled
by the departure of two of the
front "baby" teeth and the tardy
arrival of the later contingent.</p>

<p>Part of the day the child
seemed satisfied with her new-found
liberty. Having discovered
a stale crust or two in a cupboard,
she wanted no more, for her diet
had never been luxurious. Into
every corner of the house she
intruded her small freckled nose,
pulling down from shelves all
sorts of odds and ends that had
been left behind as worthless at
the flitting.</p>

<p>There was an old straw bonnet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
with a pair of dirty strings, and
therewith the damsel elected to
adorn the tousled head, which
evidenced but slight acquaintance
with comb or brush. She could
not find any feminine garments to
please her fancy, but there was a
boy's jacket, out at elbows and
ragged round the edges, which
she proudly donned, and as a
finishing touch she popped her
long slim legs, old shoes and all,
into a worn-out pair of man's top-boots
that reached to her knees.</p>

<p>"I just wish Mawm Mason had
lef' a lookin'-glass behin', so's I
could see how I look. My!
wouldn't she whack me if she
seen me with this bonnet on!"
The child smiled broadly as she
continued her confidential address
to the other valueless things left
behind. "I allays knowed she
warn't my own mother, an' I'm
glad Pete nor Matty aint my own
brother nor sister neither. I'd
like him to see me in his jacket!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>She pulled the coat across her
narrow little chest to where it
met in the days when there were
buttons on it, and marched up
and down the room, making as
much noise as possible with the
big boots.</p>

<p>This killing of time was all very
well while the daylight lasted and
the sun warmed up the frosty
November air, but when the
darkness began to assert itself
once more the small waif did not
feel so contented.</p>

<p>"There aint no use goin' over
to Mis' Morgan's. She don't
want me no more'n Mis' Mason
did. I guess I'll sleep upstairs
to-night with some o' them things
over me. I'll be warm anyhow."</p>

<p>In the middle of the front bedroom
she heaped up all the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
and crawled beneath it. A fantastic
pile it seemed to the moon
when he looked in after the rain
had stopped, the childish head
resting on the cover of an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
bandbox at one side and a pair of
man's boots sticking out at the
other.</p>

<p>The last scrap of bread was
finished next day, and the two
potatoes picked up in the yard
proved uneatable without the
softening influence of fire, so
there was nothing for it but Mrs.
Morgan's. After sunset, when
the rapidly falling temperature
and the heavy bank of clouds in
the west gave warning of a snow-storm,
the little girl, still wearing
the old bonnet, boy's jacket, and
man's boots, left the only home
she could remember, and made
her way slowly over the hard
rough fields and snake fences to
the next farmhouse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan was running in
from the barn with a shawl over
her head.</p>

<p>"Good sakes alive! Mary
Mason! I hardly knowed you.
What you got on? I thought
you was one o' them scarecrows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
out o' the fall wheat. Mis' Mason
moved to Californy three days
ago. Didn't she take you with
her?"</p>

<p>"No, mawm."</p>

<p>"So it 'pears. Wal, she hadn't
any call to, I s'pose. You aint
none o' hers."</p>

<p>By this time they were in the
kitchen of the farmhouse, Mrs.
Morgan rubbing her hands above
the stove, and Mary Mason also
venturing near, stretching out her
thin arms to the heat, for the
adopted jacket was somewhat
short in the sleeves.</p>

<p>"What's that mark on yer
wrist?"</p>

<p>"Bruise&mdash;but it don't hurt
now."</p>

<p>"Who done it?"</p>

<p>"Ma&mdash;Mis' Mason. I've lots
worse'n that on me," said the
small girl with some vanity.</p>

<p>"There, now! I jest knew
that Mis' Mason was a hard case,
though my man would never hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
to it. What you going to do
now?"</p>

<p>"I dunno." The accent implied
that to be a matter of small
moment.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose we can turn
you out to-night. There's room
in the attic for you to sleep, but
don't you go near one o' my girls'
beds with that head o' yourn."</p>

<p>As a hostess, Mrs. Morgan was
a slight improvement upon Mrs.
Mason. She never took stick or
strap to the foundling, and if she
occasionally gave her a cuff on the
ear it was never strong enough to
knock the girl down. But the
Morgan children bullied Mary
Mason, the Morgan father
grumbled at an extra mouth to
feed, and when she had been
about a month in the house the
mistress of it told her she must
move on.</p>

<p>"There's an old dress of Ellie's
you can have, an' a pair of Sue's
cast-off boots, and Tom's old cap."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where am I to go, mawm?"</p>

<p>"You jest go on from one farmhouse
to another, till you find a
place where they'll keep you all
winter. It's comin' on to Christmas,
an' people won't be hard on
ye. Tell 'em you aint got no
folks."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">M</span>y</span> wife is a theosophist.
This fact may account
for her numerous eccentricities
or be simply
one of them. I incline
to the latter opinion, because she
preferred the unbeaten to the
beaten track, both in walk and
conversation, long before Modern
Buddhism was ever heard of in the
small Western town of whose
chief newspaper (circulation
largest in Michigan) I have the
honor to be editor and proprietor.</p>

<p>How such a hot-house plant as
Theosophy ever took root in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
swamps and sands of the Wolverine
State may seem surprising at
the first glance, but let the second
rest upon our environment&mdash;the
absence of mountain or swift-flowing
river, the presence of fever
and ague and half-burnt pine
woods&mdash;and it will be seen that
this Eastern lore with its embarrassment
of symbols supplies a
long-felt want to starving imagination.
We of the West are forever
reaching beyond our grasp,
have intelligence and perception,
but lack the culture necessary for
discrimination, and therefore the
romantic souls among us who rise
above the rampant materialism
of the majority go to the other
extreme, and hail with enthusiasm
the new-old religion.</p>

<p>"It's better to believe too much
than too little, but you theosophists
swallow an awful lot," I
say to Belle when she tries to convert
me.</p>

<p>I am well aware that many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
my fellow-citizens consider me a
subject for commiseration because
I have lived for twenty years with
so erratic a house-mate, for I have
not deemed it necessary to explain
to them that without the
stimulus of her enlivening spirit,
without the element of surprise
constantly contributed by my
wife's love of variety, the daily
life, and therefore the daily paper,
of their favorite editor would partake
of that flatness which is the
predominant characteristic of this
western part of the State of
Michigan.</p>

<p>Our four sons and two daughters
enjoy their mother fully as
much as I do, for is she not the
most fascinating romancer they
ever knew? Now that they are
all of an age to be attending
school and looking out for themselves,
after the manner of independent
young Americans, they
require from her nothing but
sympathy, for their grandmother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sews their buttons on. Grandma!&mdash;Ay,
there's the rub.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in owning
that I am Scotch by birth. My
mother left her native land to
make her home with us entirely
too late in life to allow Western
ideas regarding Sabbath observance,
the rearing of children, or
the amount of respect due to the
opinion of elders, to become ingrafted
upon Scottish prejudice
concerning these matters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gemmell Senior has, however,
the national peculiarity of
judging "blood thicker than
water," and whatever her convictions
may be concerning the
methods of Mrs. Gemmell Junior,
she restricts the expression of
them to our family circle&mdash;in fact,
I may say, to myself. She generally
seizes me when I lie at my
ease on the well-worn lounge in
our sitting room, more properly
dubbed the "nursery," for it is
Liberty Hall for the youngsters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Two rooms have been knocked
into one to accommodate their
dolls' houses, bookshelves, toys,
and printing machines. Belle had
the whole side torn out of the
house to build an open fire-place,
on purpose to burn slabs, over
which the children roast pop-corn
to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>"A body wad think," said my
mother one cold night five or six
years ago, when I lay on the sofa,
trying to send my weariness off in
smoke, "A body wad think there
had been nae cherritable wark
dune in the toon ava, till they
theossiphies set aboot it. If yer
provost and baillies lookit efter
things as they ocht, there wad be
a dacent puirs-house for the idignant
folk, an' a wheen daft leddies
like Eesabel needna gang roun'
speirin' at yon infeedels for their
siller tae build a hoose o' refuse."</p>

<p>"There is a county poorhouse,
mother, but it doesn't happen to
be located in this city, and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
won't take in anybody there that
hasn't been a resident of the
county for a certain time."</p>

<p>"Aweel! there's plenty o'
kirks, though ye never darken the
door o' ane. Do they no' leuk
efter their ain puir folk?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but after nobody else's.
This House of Refuge is to
be non-sectarian, non-religious,
humanitarian, in the broadest
sense of the term. Ah! There's
Belle now," and I gave a sigh of
relief as I heard my wife's latch-key
in the front door.</p>

<p>She came in with an out-of-door
breeze, her dark face glowing
from the wintry wind, flakes
of newly fallen snow resting like
diamonds upon her prematurely
white hair, and her brown eyes
sparkling with the animation of
twenty summers rather than of
forty-two.</p>

<p>"Children all gone to bed?
That's right! Don't go, mother!
I'm sure you'll like to hear about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the House of Refuge. We've
got it fixed at last! Those rich
old lumbermen that won't give a
cent to a church, or any charity
connected with one, have gone
to the bottom of their pockets
this time. Fancy Peter Wood,
Dave&mdash;five hundred dollars!
And Jeff Henderson, five hundred.
I have the list in my bag.
Like to see it?"</p>

<p>"No' the nicht, thenk ye,"
said my mother stiffly, but I
added:</p>

<p>"Hand it over to me, and I'll
put it in to-morrow's <i>Echo</i>.
That's what they want."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, you old
cynic! I shan't tell you another
thing about it." But still she
went on: "We've taken the old
Laurence house on the corner
of Garfield Avenue and Pine
Street, and it's to be fitted up
to accommodate any sort of refugees."</p>

<p>"Irrespective of race, creed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sex, or color," I whispered parenthetically.</p>

<p>"No one is ever to be turned
from the door without a good
square meal, and there's to be a
back, outside stair erected, up
which a tramp can go at any hour
of the night, and find a nice clean
bed awaiting him&mdash;locked away
from the rest of the house, of
course."</p>

<p>"Oh, why?" I innocently inquired.
"Surely you have
enough faith in your brother man
to believe that he would not
commit any breach of hospitality?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have," replied Belle, squeezing
my recumbent form further
against the back of the sofa, upon
which she had seated herself.
"But remember we are not all
theosophists on the Board."</p>

<p>In the words of the historic
witness against Mrs. Muldoon,
"That's the way the row began!"
Belle was elected Treasurer of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the House of Refuge, but as she
knows nothing of figures, I had
to keep the books of that unique
institution, and was therefore
enabled to form a practical estimate
of its workings.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt a description
of the numerous "cases" in
which my advice, if not my
pocketbook, was freely drawn
upon, but shall leave them,
along with the description of
the many antecedent fads of my
beloved better half, to some historian
of longer wind, and shall
content myself with recounting
the particular "case"&mdash;and attachments&mdash;which
most nearly
affected our family life and happiness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"This is what I call solid comfort,"
said Belle to me one evening
late in September, as we sat
in the parlor in a couple of deep,
springy armchairs, fronting a huge
grate fire, that would be banished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
by the lighting of the furnace.
"Children all in school again,
your mother off on a long visit,
and plenty of new books on the
table."</p>

<p>I looked up from one of the
aforesaid new books.</p>

<p>"Just wait! The season's business
hasn't begun in the Refuge
yet."</p>

<p>"Everything is in good shape
for it, though. We've had enough
donations of groceries and vegetables
to keep us going almost all
winter. We've lots of wood for
the furnace, and Mack and Hardy
have given us some second-hand
furniture and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The electric door-bell sent out a
long, imperative summons.</p>

<p>"Who can that be, Dave, at
this time of night? None of the
boys locked out?"</p>

<p>"No; they all went up to bed
a while ago."</p>

<p>Belle rose and walked to the
door. I pulled the tidy from my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
chair-back over my bald head to
protect me from the draught, but
that did not prevent me from
hearing what went on.</p>

<p>"Are you Mrs. Gemmell?"
This from a female voice, breathless
with excitement.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Then you are one of the
trustees of the House of Refuge?"
gasped another feminine speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes. Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. We've just
come to tell you about this young
girl who has run to us for protection."</p>

<p>"We're school-teachers, mawm."</p>

<p>"She's in my class, and she
hasn't a friend in the city and
knew nowhere else to go."</p>

<p>Then followed some hysterical
whispers, which roused my curiosity
so much that I went to the
door and peeped over the shoulder
of my tall wife. The two plain,
business-like young women were
evidently much distressed, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
between them was a fair-haired
slip of a girl of fifteen or sixteen,
the least disturbed of the group.
The three older women might
have been talking in a foreign
tongue, or of someone else, so unconcerned
did she appear, present
danger being over.</p>

<p>"How did she happen to be
with these people?" Belle was
asking as I came forward.</p>

<p>"The wife of this brute of a
man told us that she was nursemaid
with the Ferguson Family
Concert Company, but they
dropped her here in Lake City
without a friend or a cent."</p>

<p>"She took her in to help sell
fruit and ice cream evenings, and
she let her go to school through
the day."</p>

<p>At this juncture the subject
under discussion broke into a
beaming smile, showing all her
fine teeth. Her cheek dimpled
and reddened, and her blue eyes,
full of fun, looked straight into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mine. I became suddenly aware
that I had forgotten to remove
the tidy, and retired in confusion,
but heard Belle's conclusion of
the interview:</p>

<p>"Just wait a second till I give
you a line to the matron of the
House of Refuge. You can leave
the girl there till we see what can
be done for her. She'll be perfectly
safe, and had better keep
on going to school as usual."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A week afterward I asked my
wife what had become of her
latest <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>"You mean Mary Mason?
She's in the refuge yet, attending
school, and we've settled that
man's ice-cream saloon."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Boycotted him. We can't
reach him any other way."</p>

<p>"That's rather hard on his wife,
who seems to be a decent sort of
party."</p>

<p>"The innocent often appear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
suffer with and for the guilty,
but if you understood the law of
Karma you would know that all
the evil that befalls us is really
the result of some wrongdoing of
our own in a previous incarnation.
Mary Mason herself is an instance."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"Poor girl! She's been
knocked from pillar to post all
her days. She hasn't an idea
who her parents are, and there
isn't a creature in the world she
has any claim upon. She must
have gone very far astray <i>last
time</i> to have been brought into
the world again with such disadvantages."</p>

<p>"It appears to me she has a
great many advantages&mdash;lovely
blue eyes, good teeth, the fashionable
golden shade of hair, and
the prettiest complexion I've seen
for many a day."</p>

<p>"Don't be provoking, Dave!
The poor little thing has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
marks of some of her beatings on
her yet. The Ferguson family
were the first who ever treated her
decently, or paid her any wages."</p>

<p>"Why did they drop her?"</p>

<p>"One of our Committee took
it upon herself to write and ask
them. They replied that the girl
was of perfectly good character,
so far as they knew, but she fell
so ridiculously in love with Frank
Ferguson, their eldest son, that she
was making a nuisance of herself,
and so they had to let her go."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"There are generally two sides
to that kind of story."</p>

<p>"At the meeting of the trustees
to-morrow it is to be decided
what's to be done with her, because
she says she doesn't want to go to
school any more. She's never had
much of a chance before to learn
anything, and she's in a class with
little bits of girls, and she doesn't
like it&mdash;says she'd rather go to
work to earn her own living."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Belle came home from that
meeting with her face ablaze with
righteous wrath. Her hands
trembled so much over the teacups
at our evening meal that
even sixteen year old Watty, our
eldest son, remarked it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with
<i>mamma</i>? Her trolley's off."</p>

<p>I knew there was trouble in the
wind, so I fortified myself with a
good supper and read my paper at
the same time, to leave myself free
for what was to follow. The
children study their lessons in the
back end of the nursery, and I
therefore forbore to take up my
usual position upon the sofa, but
withdrew to the parlor with my
pipe.</p>

<p>Presently my wife followed me,
nearly walking over the furniture
in her excitement.</p>

<p>"Go on, Belle; out with it!"</p>

<p>"You will listen, will you, seriously?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, mawm. I never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had any sort of an objection to
your making a scavenger barrel of
me, so go ahead."</p>

<p>"Oh, these benevolent women,
Dave! Any one of them alone
is as good-hearted as can be, but
lump them together on a committee,
and they're as cold and
cruel and grasping as the meanest
business man you could name!"</p>

<p>"More so!" said I, approvingly,
and for once Isabel did not
resent the disparagement of her
sex.</p>

<p>"The question arose, what was
to be done about Mary Mason,
and every one of them, David&mdash;every
one of them, with young
daughters of their own growing
up at home, voted to let that girl
go round this town selling a
book."</p>

<p>"Was that what she wanted to
do herself?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but think of them letting
her do it! You know as well
as I do what sort of a city this is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and whether it's safe for a lovely
girl like that to go to men's
offices, trying with her pretty
looks and ways to wheedle them
into subscribing for Stanley's
'Darkest Africa.' Oh, I was
wild! I said to Mrs. Robinson:
'How would you like your Lulu
to do it?' 'The cases are very
different,' said she; 'my daughter
has no need to earn her living.'
'Mrs. Constable,' said I, 'if your
grandchild were left alone in the
world, what would you think of
the charity of any body of women
who allowed her to go from under
their protection to make her living
in this way?' 'I don't see
the connection,' said she; 'Mary
Mason's been fighting the world
since she was seven years old, and
just because she happens to have
a pretty face, you seem to think
she should be put in a glass case
and never do anything for herself.'"</p>

<p>"She had you there, Belle,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
said I, pulling her down to the
arm of my big easy-chair. "Let
the girl alone; she'll come out all
right. She's too good-looking for
a nurse or a housemaid, and she
doesn't know enough arithmetic
to be a shop girl. I don't see
what else she can do."</p>

<p>"That's just what the ladies
calmly decided," said my wife,
walking the floor again. "They
seemed to think that a little business
training would just be the
making of Mary. Oh, these
Christians!"</p>

<p>"You see, my dear," said I,
"committees are not supposed to
have any conscience. They have
the income of the Refuge in trust
for the contributors, and they
have no right to keep on supporting
a girl who is willing to work
for herself. How she proposes
to do it is none of their business."</p>

<p>"That's just what it is&mdash;their
business; their business to see
that she doesn't meet the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fate we've saved her from once
already. Oh! there's no getting
these narrow-minded, orthodox,
bigoted people to see more than
one side of a question."</p>

<p>"Take care you don't become
dogmatic on your own side," said
I, rising to knock the ashes out of
my pipe. "If it's the law of
Karma that's responsible for her
having been left to shift for herself
at so early an age, it's the
same law that's after her now, and
I wouldn't interfere with its operations,
if I were you."</p>

<p>"You don't in the least understand
what you are talking about,"
and Belle sailed from the room
to settle a noisy dispute in the
nursery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">T</span>hrough</span> that winter
I caught occasionally a
glimpse of Mary Mason
on the street, but as I
had not the pleasure of
her acquaintance, I did not stop
to ask her how she was getting
on. My wife told me, however,
that she lived in a room over a
store down town, and took her
meals out, and that she was succeeding
very well with her subscription
list.</p>

<p>"The girl is all right, if only the
gossips would let her alone.
Some of them assert that she had
a child in the Refuge, and though
the ladies on our committee indignantly
deny that, they shake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
their heads, and say of course
they don't know anything about
her now."</p>

<p>"It's the only excitement a lot
of these women have," said I.
"They wouldn't read a French
novel for the world, and some of
them wouldn't be seen in a
theater, so they have to satisfy
their morbid craving for sensationalism
by hearing and repeating
all sorts of unsavory tales&mdash;and
they do it in the name of
charity! They're very sorry that
there is so much wickedness in
the world, but since it is there,
they enjoy the investigation of
details, and it doesn't matter very
much whether they're doing any
good or not."</p>

<p>"There aren't any details to investigate,
so far as Mary Mason
is concerned. I took pains to
make sure of that, when I heard
that a big hulk of a machinist,
who rooms on the same flat, was
telling lies about her, just because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
she refused to have anything to
say to him."</p>

<p>When I was leaving the <i>Echo</i>
office at noon one day I saw Henderson's
handsome black span,
with the wreck of a sleigh behind
them, come down the street at a
full gallop, and I was just debating
with myself whether my duty
as a citizen, which called me to
attempt to stop the brutes, was
stronger than my duty to my wife
and family, which bade me stay
where I was, when a young lady
jumped the snow ridge at the
edge of the sidewalk and flung
herself at the bit of the nearest
horse. The powerful animal
swung her right off her feet, but
he was checked for an instant,
and in that instant a young
man seized the mate on the
other side; the team was stopped
and surrounded by a crowd directly.
Then I saw it was Mary
Mason who was the heroine of the
drama. She withdrew from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
throng, straightened her flat hat
above her rosy face, and walked
off with her habitual indifferent
air.</p>

<p>"She's got good grit, that girl,"
said I to myself, but I thought no
more about her till I came home
on a certain evening in March, and
found her comfortably ensconced
on one side of our nursery fire,
while my mother from the other
side cast suspicious glances at
her over her spectacles. "Miss
Mason," had supper with us, and
then I retired to my big leather-covered
spring rocker in the
parlor to await developments.
That chair needs to be approached
with deference, for it has a precocious
trick of either tilting in
the air the feet of any unwary
occupant, or of tipping him out
on the floor. I know its disposition,
can preserve my proper balance,
and have never been flung
either forward or backward&mdash;except
once each way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Belle followed me,
"loaded up," as the boys say.</p>

<p>"It seems as if I was never to
get free from the responsibility of
that child."</p>

<p>"What's up now?"</p>

<p>"Down town to-day I met the
chief of police&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great chum of yours!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. We've had considerable
conversation at different
times about some of my cases.
To-day he said, 'You're interested
in that young girl, Mary Mason,
aint you, Mrs. Gemmell?' 'Yes,'
said I, though my heart sank, and
I didn't see why he couldn't have
addressed any other one of the
committee; 'anything wrong with
her?' 'Not yet,' said he; 'but
there will be pretty soon if somebody
doesn't look after her.
There's a scheme on foot to take
her off to Chicago&mdash;to sell a book&mdash;so
they say.' 'Good gracious!
Nobody would dare!' 'Wouldn't
they, though?' said he. 'There's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a well-known drummer in this
town at the bottom of it. He's
aware the girl has no friends, and
in Chicago she don't even know a
soul. It's too bad, for I've had
my eye on the young woman all
winter, and she's kept perfectly
straight.'</p>

<p>"You may think, Dave, that I
ought to be hardened to horrors
by this time, but I became fairly
dazed as the chief of police went
on to say, 'I can't move in the
matter. We never can touch these
things until the mischief is done;
but if you like to make inquiries,
you'll find out that I've been telling
you the truth.'</p>

<p>"When he left me, I turned to
come home, not knowing what to
do, but going round the first
corner, didn't I run right into
Mary Mason herself! I hadn't
laid eyes on her for a couple of
months. 'How d'ye do, Mrs.
Gemmell?' she said, for I stopped
and stared at her as if she'd been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a white crow. 'What about
"Darkest Africa?"' I found
breath to ask, though it was
Darkest Chicago I had in my
mind. 'I've done with that now,'
she said; 'did very well, too.'
'And what are you going to
do next?' 'I dunno. Whatever
turns up. I've got an offer to go
to Chicago to sell a book there.'
I caught her by the arm as if I'd
been the chief of police. 'Mary,
will you please go to my house
and wait there for me till I come?'
'Oh, yes, mawm, if you want me
to,' and off she went, asking no
questions.</p>

<p>"Well, Dave, I've put in four
hours of amateur detective work
this afternoon, and I feel as if I
needed a moral bath. I found
out it was all true, as the chief of
police had said. There was a
plot to ruin the girl, and I don't
think the author of it will forget
his interview with me in a hurry."</p>

<p>"What good will that do the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
young woman? There are plenty
more of his kind in the world, and
with her inherited tendencies I
suppose it's only a question of
time&mdash;how soon she goes to the
bad."</p>

<p>"David Gemmell!"</p>

<p>It is worth while making a
caustic speech occasionally to see
Isabel rise to her full height.
Her brown eyes positively emit
sparks, and her gray hair, which
she wears waved and parted, gives
her an air of distinction that
would not be out of place upon
an avenging spirit.</p>

<p>"I came home all tired out,"
she went on, sinking into the
chair beside mine, "and looking
through the nursery window,
there sat Mary Mason with our
little Chrissie on her knee. The
two faces in the firelight looked
so much alike that my heart gave
a great thump, and I vowed that
girl should never be set adrift
again. This is the second time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
she has been cast upon my shore,
and I must see to her."</p>

<p>So Mary Mason dropped into
our family circle without anybody
having very much to say in the
matter&mdash;except my mother!</p>

<p>"Wha's yon 'at Eesabell's ta'en
up wi' the noo?"</p>

<p>"Her name's Mason," said I;
"Mary Mason."</p>

<p>"I h'ard yer wife was thinkin'
o' keepin' a hoosemaid, but I
didna expeck tae see her pap hersel'
doon at the table wi' the
fem'ly."</p>

<p>"She's not a housemaid. She's
just staying with us for a while."</p>

<p>"Ye'd think Eesabell micht
hae eneugh adae wi' her ain,
'thoot takin' in ony strangers."</p>

<p>"But Mary is to help with the
housework, in return for her
board and clothes."</p>

<p>"Let her wear a kep an' apron,
then, an' eat wi' Marg'et."</p>

<p>"Margaret might object," and
I laughed at the probable dismay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of our stalwart, rough-and-ready
five-foot-tenner, should this ladyfied
blonde permanently invade
her domain.</p>

<p>"Hoo lang's she gaun to st'y?"</p>

<p>"That's more than I can tell
you."</p>

<p>When Mary had been a week
in the house, it became apparent
that something must be done
with her.</p>

<p>"She's bound she'll not go
back to the public school, Dave,
and yet she cannot read or write.
Do you think we can afford to
send her to boarding-school&mdash;to a
convent, for instance, where she'd
be well looked after, and allowances
made for her backwardness?"</p>

<p>Belle and I were out driving
together. It was the first springlike
evening we had had, and I
was trying Jim Atwood's new
mare on Maple Avenue, which
had been newly block-paved. So
engrossed was I in watching her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
paces I did not reply to my wife
at once, and she continued:</p>

<p>"You were going to get me a
horse and a victoria this spring,
but I'm willing to give them up
to send Mary to school."</p>

<p>"Please yourself, my dear.
You would be the one to use the
turnout. I'm content to borrow
from my friends. Isn't she a
beauty?"</p>

<p>Belle came out of space to
answer me.</p>

<p>"Yes, just now; but she'll not
be when she's old. Her features
are not good at all; her forehead's
too narrow, and her nose
too broad. Were it not for her
lovely hair and complexion, she'd
have nothing to brag about but
a pair of very ordinary blue eyes."</p>

<p>"Who? The mare?"</p>

<p>"Don't be stupid, Dave, and
do attend to what I am saying.
I hardly ever have a chance to
speak to you, goodness knows!"</p>

<p>"You get the editorial ear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
oftener and longer than anybody
else."</p>

<p>"Lend it to me now, then.
Don't you think a convent would
be the best place for Mary?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;as there are no
theosophical educational institutions
that we know about."</p>

<p>"Mary isn't far enough on for
theosophist yet. She'll have to
come back many times before she
is. The Roman Catholic Church
is on her plane this incarnation."</p>

<p>"It does seem to catch the
masses, that's a fact, whereas
your theosophy doesn't appear
to be practicable for uneducated
people nor for children."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you there."</p>

<p>"Then why were you so anxious
to send Watty to a church school
to finish his education, and why
are you on the lookout already
for a boarding-school for the two
girls where they will have the
best of Christian influences?
What is your object in being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
so particular that the younger
boys are regular in their attendance
at our surpliced choir?"</p>

<p>"It gives them a good idea of
music&mdash;but that is not the point
just now. Can we afford to send
Mary Mason to a convent, or can
we not?"</p>

<p>"Choose between her and the
buggy mare 'suitable for a lady
to drive,'" said I; but in reality
it was my mother who settled the
question.</p>

<p>When we came home that
evening she was sitting by the
fireside,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nursin' her wrath to keep it warm."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ye maun either pit yon hizzy
oot the hoose, or I'll hitta gang."</p>

<p>"What's the matter now,
mother?"</p>

<p>"I tell't her to brush the boys'
bits tae be ready for the schule in
the mornin'. They were thrang
wi' their lessons an' she wasna
daein' a han's turn."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"S'y! I wush ye'd seen the
leuk she gi'ed me!"</p>

<p>"The boys can brush their ain
bits," said she; "I'm no' their
servant."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"It's well seen she hasn't been
brought up in Scotland, or she
would know it was the bounden
duty of the girls in the house to
wait on the boys."</p>

<p>"An' a hantle better it is than
to see the laddies aye rinnin' efter
the lasses, tendin' them han' an'
fut as they dae here. When a
man comes hame efter his d'y's
wark, he should be let sit on his
sate, an' hae a' things dune for
him."</p>

<p>"David," said Belle, sinking to
a footstool at my feet with a
dramatic gesture, "you shall
never button my boots again!
But seriously," she continued, as
mother withdrew in high dudgeon
to her sanctum upstairs, "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
think Mary should be expected
to brush the boys' boots. We
didn't engage her as servant, and
even if we had, there isn't a hired
girl in this part of the country
that wouldn't make a fuss if she
had to brush the boots of the
man of the house, not to mention
the boys. We'll have to pack
Mary off somewhere, if only to
keep the peace."</p>

<p>So Mary was sent to a convent,
and at the end of three months
came back for her holidays to
our summer cottage at Interlaken.
Being so near the big lake does
not agree with my mother, and
she rarely spends more than a
week with us there, but during
July and August visits my married
sister in town. The coast
was clear for Belle and me to decide
what progress had been made
in the making of Mary, and we
fancied we discovered a good deal.</p>

<p>"What have they done to you,
those nuns, to tone you down so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
quickly, Mary?" I asked, as she
sat beside me, swinging in a low
rocker, and looking so pretty that
I was quite proud of her as an
ornament to our front veranda.</p>

<p>"I dunno," she said, "unless it
was the exercise for sitting perfectly
still on a row of chairs. A
nun goes behind us and drops a
big book or something, and any
girl that jumps gets a bad mark."</p>

<p>"Capital!" I cried; "no wonder
you have learned repose of
manner."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the girl continued:</p>

<p>"Then we have little parties
and receptions, and we have to
converse with the nuns and with
each other, and anybody that
mentions one of the three D's
gets a bad mark."</p>

<p>"The three D's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;Dress, Disease, and
Domestics."</p>

<p>"Hear this, Belle," I said, laughing,
as my wife took the rocking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
chair on the other side of me;
"fancy any collection of women
being obliged to steer clear of the
three D's!"</p>

<p>"You should ask Mary about
her studies," was the severe reply.
"We were much pleased with
your letters."</p>

<p>"Yes, mawm; Sister Stella was
always very good about that;
helped me with the big words,
and often wrote the whole thing
out for me. Sometimes I had to
copy it two or three times before
I could please her."</p>

<p>Belle hastily changed the subject.
"Let Mr. Gemmell hear
that piece you recited to me this
morning."</p>

<p>I am no judge of elocution, but
the general effect of the young
girl standing there in the arch of
the veranda, a clematis-wreathed
post on either side, and her face,
with its delicate coloring, turned
toward the golden twilight, was
pleasing in the extreme.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"She'll maybe be famous some
day," said Belle, when Mary had
discreetly retired. "She is far
quicker at learning verses off by
heart than she is at reading
them."</p>

<p>"Still, to be a successful elocutionist
nowadays one has to be
thoroughly well educated, and
Mary is too late in beginning."</p>

<p>"You can't tell. She's got the
appearance, and that's half the
battle."</p>

<p>"With us, perhaps; but remember,
we are not capable critics,
even though one of us is a
Theosophist."</p>

<p>"Laugh as you like, Dave.
Theosophy satisfies me, because
it explains some things in my
own nature that I never could understand
before."</p>

<p>"It may be that you are too
soon satisfied. That's the way
with all new movements&mdash;one
story is good till another is told.
Your great-granddaughter will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
smile at the credulity of your
ideas on this very subject."</p>

<p>"She can smile, and so can you.
We don't pretend to know everything;
we only hope that we are
on the right road to learn. I, for
one, am thankful to think that
there are wiser heads than mine
puzzling over the problem of our
psychic powers. I've always
taken impressions from inanimate
objects, and it has bothered me.
Now I find my sensations analyzed
and classified under the head of
Psychometry, and it is a comfort
to know that other people besides
myself can discern an <i>aura</i>, and
are foolishly wise enough to trust
the impressions they receive in
that way."</p>

<p>"But if I were you, I don't
think I'd make a parlor entertainment
out of the gift,&mdash;if it is a
gift,&mdash;as I heard you did at the
Wades' the other night."</p>

<p>"Who told you? What have
you heard?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Newspaper men hear everything.
You asked Mr. Saxon to
hold his handkerchief pressed
tightly in his hand for a few
minutes, and then to give it to
you. You shut your eyes as you
held it, and received the impression
of his 'aura,' or the atmosphere
which surrounds him, or
whatever you like to call it, and
then the company asked you
questions, and you gave him a
great old character. He didn't
like it a bit, nor did his wife, nor
his mother-in-law. You'll make
enemies for yourself if you don't
watch out."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> wrong of me to exercise
my powers just to gratify idle
curiosity. No good Theosophist
would approve of it."</p>

<p>"Say, rather, 'no sensible person
would.' The Theosophists
haven't a monopoly of common
sense. To me they appear
slightly deficient in that article,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
but I dare say they make up for it
in uncommon sense."</p>

<p>"You speak more wisely than
you know," said Belle solemnly.
"If I hadn't taken in some of the
Brotherhood ideas I wonder where
that pretty, innocent young girl
would have been by this time.
Would you like me to go back and
be as I was in the old days, a rank
materialist, caring for nothing but
dress, dancing, and having a good
time? You know you wouldn't,
David. You know as well as I do
that Theosophy has been the
making of me, and through me it
shall be the making of Mary too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">T</span>o</span> the Scotchman or
Englishman, with Loch
Katrine or Windermere
in his fond memory's
eye, it is not surprising
that the great lakes of America
seem howling wildernesses of water,
for the shores are mostly low
and unpicturesque. There is no
changing tide to give variety, no
strong smell of seaweed nor salt
breeze to brace the wearied
nerves, but the wearied nerves are
braced nevertheless. The sand is
soft and clean to extend one's
length upon, and the waves forever
rolling up at one's feet are
soothing in their monotony.
There is no fear of the encroach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ment
of the water, no fear of its
leaving a bare mud-flat for nearly
a mile; and the unlimited expanse
of blue which meets the
horizon satisfies the eye, which
cares not if the land on the other
side be hundreds or thousands of
miles away, so long as it be out of
sight.</p>

<p>Two young people one evening
in July seemed to find Lake
Michigan perfectly satisfactory in
every respect. The girl sat on a
log of driftwood, poking holes in
the sand with the pointed toes of
her shoes, much too fine for the
purpose, while the young man
stretched at her feet looked at her
instead of the sunset they had
come to admire. I could not
help thinking what a pretty picture
they made, as I strolled along
the shore with my pipe, to get
cooled off after a very hot day in
town.</p>

<p>The family were all at Interlaken,
but Margaret was left in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Lake City to keep the grass
watered, and to give me my midday
dinner. I am unable to decide
which occupation she considered
the more important. It is
not easy to get grass to grow with
us, and anyone who can display
a reasonably green patch in July
and August gives evidence of considerable
perseverance in the
matter of lawn sprinkling. I told
Margaret she would be ready to
enter the Fire Brigade next winter,
she was getting to be such an expert
with the hose. But to return
to the shore of Michigan.</p>

<p>The pair of lovers interested
me so much that I gradually
edged nearer to them. The species
seldom objects to the proximity
of a stout little man with a
prosaic pipe in his mouth and a
pair of light blue eyes, handicapped
by spectacles, that seem
always to be looking for a sail on
the horizon. In fact, I never
attract any attention anywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
unless my wife is along, and then
I am only too proud and happy to
shine in her reflection.</p>

<p>So I sat down on a piece of
stump, worn white and smooth
like a skeleton before being cast
up by the waves; but when the
two caught sight of me, the man
sprang up and came toward me,
holding out his hand, while the
girl sauntered off in the other
direction, and I saw that she was
Mary Mason.</p>

<p>"Hello, Link?" said I to the
young fellow. "Didn't know you
were down here."</p>

<p>"I'm at the hotel for a week or
two. I've just been making the
acquaintance of your adopted
daughter."</p>

<p>"My what?"</p>

<p>"You have adopted her, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't know that I have&mdash;hadn't
considered the matter at
all."</p>

<p>"She's a sweet girl, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beauty too. Anyone would be
proud to own her."</p>

<p>"You'd better let Dolly Martin
hear you say that."</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln Todd straightened
himself up in the most independent
bachelor style.</p>

<p>"She can look after me when
we're married, but in the meantime
I'm a free man."</p>

<p>He is considered very handsome,
tall and dark, a good business man
too, and Belle had quite approved
of the engagement between him
and Dolly Martin, who, though
not a pretty girl, was strong and
sensible, and the daughter of one
of her oldest friends.</p>

<p>Lincoln must be taking advantage
of his intimacy with our
family to flirt with Mary Mason.</p>

<p>Interlaken is not a fashionable
resort. Even the hotel is a
homely abode, which the guests
seem to run themselves, though
they generally prefer to live outdoors
and go inside only for meals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and beds. Once in a while, on a
chilly evening, the young people
get up a dance, and some of us
older folks are dragged into it too.</p>

<p>Scotchmen love to dance, and I
am no exception. I am not up
to waltzing or any of the newfangled
round dances, but give
me a Highland schottische, or a
square dance, when there is an inventive
genius to call off the
figures and prescribe plenty of
variety. There was no professional
caller-off at Interlaken, but
Lincoln Todd did duty for one as
he danced. When he tired of it,
and led off into a round of waltzes,
ripples, jerseys, bon tons, rush
polkas, and goodness knows what
besides, I remained as a wall-flower.</p>

<p>The reason that I sat there was
that I could not take my eyes off
Mary Mason. Where she learned
to dance I know not, but dance
she did, with a grace and <i>abandon</i>
that made every other girl in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
room a clod-hopper. Lincoln
Todd was quite infatuated with
her.</p>

<p>Ours is one of the dozen or so
of cottages that radiate from the
big hotel. Most of the cottagers
take dinner and supper at the
hotel, being, like ourselves, in a
servantless condition. Belle said
she could get along perfectly well
without Margaret, when she had
Mary Mason to help her with the
housework, and, indeed, there was
not much to be done. The four
bedrooms open into one central
room that we call the sitting-room,
but it is only in wet weather
it justifies the name, for, as a rule,
we sit in rockers or swing in hammocks
on the broad veranda that
runs round three sides of the
house. The cottages lie so close
together that a good jumper can
easily spring from one veranda to
the next, and the lady proprietors
gossip across, and the men
too when they come down from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
business every evening, or from
Saturday till Monday. My lot is
generally the shorter allowance,
and one Sunday afternoon I lay
in my favorite hammock on the
north side of the veranda, sleeping
the sleep of the brain-tired
editor, till voices roused me.</p>

<p>"Mary, where did you get that
new tennis racket?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Todd gave it to me."</p>

<p>"Haven't I told you distinctly
that you were not even to take
candy from Mr. Todd?"</p>

<p>"He gives things to you and
Chrissie."</p>

<p>"That's a very different matter.
Chrissie is a child, and he is an
old friend of the family."</p>

<p>"I can't help it if he likes to
give me presents."</p>

<p>"You can help taking them,
especially from an engaged man."</p>

<p>"I don't care if he is engaged.
He says he don't care anything
at all about Miss Martin. He
only went after her for her money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
He likes me best, and he says he'll
never marry her."</p>

<p>"Mary! I should think you'd
know better than to make yourself
so cheap. You give Mr. Todd
back that racket right away, and
tell him Mrs. Gemmell said you
were not to keep it, and the next
time he brings you down flowers
or chocolates you do the same."</p>

<p>If I had not known the sex and
the approximate age of Mary,
I should have thought it was a
small boy in a temper who stamped
off the veranda.</p>

<p>The next Saturday night the
full moon was assisted in her
duties by a large bonfire down on
our beach. The Adamless Eden,
having received its "week-end"
male contingent, was stimulated
to a corn-roasting. The green
ears, stuck on the ends of long
sticks, were held by girls and men
over the fire till roasted, and then
passed on to a row of matrons,
disguised in large aprons, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
salted and buttered them ready
for eating. If you know anything
that tastes sweeter than a freshly
roasted and buttered ear of Indian
corn, your experience is broader
than mine.</p>

<p>Using my eyes habitually in
the way of business, I could not
avoid noticing that Lincoln Todd
was not collecting his share of
driftwood for keeping up the fire,
nor did I see Mary Mason's pretty
face in the garland of beauties
bending with eager interest over
the poles bayoneted with cobs of
corn. It may have been fear of
spoiling her complexion that
kept her at one side whispering
with Link, but it served them
both right that Dolly Martin
should choose that very moment
for her stage entrance. She and
her mother joined the group of
butterers, and I noticed that Mrs.
Martin returned Belle's cordial
greeting rather stiffly. Then
Miss Dolly calmly walked over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the pair sitting apart, having evidently
recognized the back of
Lincoln's blazer. She pretended
to stumble over one of his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me!" said she;
and when Link sprang up, Mary
Mason had the pleasure of witnessing
the warmest sort of a meeting
between the engaged lovers.
They sallied off in the moonlight,
his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>No one but me noticed the
young girl slipping down on the
sand, and laying her head on the
log on which she had been sitting,
and even I pretended not to see
that her handkerchief was in
action.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mary!" said I, "I'll
match you skipping stones. Look
at this!"</p>

<p>With that I sent a beautiful flat
one skimming along with nearly a
dozen hops in the brilliant track
of the moon on the water. She
did not pay any attention to me
at first, and I kept skipping away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
just as if I did not see her mopping
her eyes. By-and-by a stroke
worthy of myself sent a pebble
spinning through the ripples, and
Mary's ready laugh rang out beside
me. Within twenty minutes of
Dolly Martin's appearance on the
scene, "Mamie" was the center
of the corn-roasters, and the gayest
of the gay. Belle told me she
kept on that line of conduct during
the whole week that Miss Martin
and her mother stayed at the
hotel.</p>

<p>"It seemed to me that Dolly
took a special pleasure in parading
her happiness before poor Mary,
but Mary never showed the white
feather."</p>

<p>"There's the making of a fine
woman in her."</p>

<p>"That may be," said my wife.
"But this last week she has been
extremely wearing on me. Having
no particular man on the
string, she has followed me about
like a spaniel, wanted to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
what I'm reading, and has begun
a book the minute I'm through
with it."</p>

<p>"I've seen her carrying 'The
Coming Race' about with her
lately, but I notice that the bookmark
always stays in the same
place."</p>

<p>Mary became fond of solitary
rambles back in the pine woods,
intersected by plank walks that
made promenading possible.
People liked to wander through
there in the evenings, when the
camp-lights in the hollows lent a
mysterious charm, and on up to
the big Knight Templar's Building,
erected on the highest point
of the sandy bluff overlooking
Lake Michigan. Every night
that prominent structure blazed
with electric lights, and sometimes
a band played on the veranda;
but the only visitors were cottagers
and guests from the hotel,
who went up there to walk about
and enjoy the prospect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Our city editor often surprises
me with the depth and breadth of
his local information. For example,
I opened the <i>Echo</i> one
day to be made aware that "Miss
Mamie Gemmell" had outstripped
all the lady bicyclists in town by
making the distance between Lake
City and Interlaken in forty-seven
minutes. It was also remarked
that she was one of the most
graceful lady riders on the road.</p>

<p>I wonder how many generations
a man must be removed from
Scotland before he becomes callous
to the disposition of the
family name. I own that I
squirmed inwardly, but with outward
composure asked Belle
where Mary got the "bike."</p>

<p>"Watty's old one. He taught
Mary to ride it, and then made
her a present of it, for he's set his
heart on a new wheel."</p>

<p>"Confoundedly generous of
him!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you look at it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
way. It is so seldom that he
does give up anything for anybody,
I thought he ought to be
encouraged, and I said he should
have a new bicycle with pneumatic
tires and all the latest improvements
at Christmas, if you
did not see fit to give it to him
sooner."</p>

<p>In August I took my annual
day's fishing, which has come to
be rather a joke in the house,
because, in spite of my elaborate
preparations the night before, and
the unheard-of hour at which I
rise in the morning, I have never
been known to catch anything
worth bringing home.</p>

<p>This time my companion was a
journalist from Chicago, an ardent
young fellow, who could not keep
from "shop" even when off on
his holidays, and who had started
a small weekly paper in which
were to be recorded the doings of
a certain congress holding a summer
session in our grove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>We rowed up the little lake on
the edge of the lily-pads, fishing
both sides of it, but caught
nothing except a sunfish or two.
Then we lit our pipes and talked.</p>

<p>"What an extremely clever
young lady that adopted daughter
of yours is. I heard only the
other day that she is not your
own."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. No one would believe
it to talk to her, but she's
got a surprisingly bright mind for
one so young. She can't be more
than seventeen, but her descriptions
are good enough for one of
the best magazines, and she has
evidently thought a lot on all the
leading topics of the day. Why,
she's up in Hypnotism, Evolution,
Theosophy&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! How did you
find all that out?"</p>

<p>Thereupon he fished from his
pocket a couple of his tiresome
little publications.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I asked her to write something
for our paper, that's how I
know. Want to see?"</p>

<p>I do not set up to be a literary
critic, but I guess I know my own
wife's style of composition when I
encounter it. During the two
years that we were engaged she
lived in Detroit and I in Indiana,
and I missed her letters so much
after we were married that to this
day she is in the habit of letting
me read those she writes to other
people. I was not going to give
her away to that newspaper man,
though, for the name "Mary
Gemmell" stared me in the face
from the end of each article; but
I remonstrated with Belle when I
reached home.</p>

<p>"How could I help it, Dave?
There was the girl teasing me to
write something for her because
this fellow had asked her to do it.
She said I could scribble down
something just as easy as not, and
then she could copy it for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Copy it! She took hours to do it,
and I considered she deserved all
the praise she got for the articles."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do it again, if I
were you. It sets the girl sailing
under false colors."</p>

<p>"Poor Mary! Her one little
accomplishment has been of no
use to her since that professional
elocutionist came to the hotel, and
I hated to see her cast altogether
into the shade, especially while
Dolly Martin was here."</p>

<p>Still there came another production
from the pen of Miss Mary
Gemmell.</p>

<p>"Really, Belle," said I, "this is
carrying the joke too far."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about it.
Some of the old cats at the hotel
began to suspect that Mary hadn't
written those things, and accused
me to my face of doing it myself,
so I had to write an account of
the picnic up the little lake, because
they all know I wasn't there
at all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let this be the last, then."</p>

<p>"It shall, I assure you, for I
am much displeased with Mary.
Since Mrs. Martin and Dolly left,
she's been going it just as hard as
ever with Lincoln Todd. If you
walk up to the Knight Templar's
Building I'll warrant you'll find
them there promenading this very
minute."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, because I passed
them just a little while ago as I
came through the woods, sitting
on a secluded bench, his arm
round her waist and her head on
his shoulder."</p>

<p>"Didn't they see you?"</p>

<p>"I dare say, but I never let on I
saw them. What's the use? I
can't be expected to leave the
<i>Echo</i> to my subs, and come down
here to play special policeman
to Mary Mason. I should have
thought Todd was more of a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"So should I, but I've spoken
to him, quarreled with him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
indeed, so that he doesn't come
near the house, but I know that
he and Mary meet just the same.
Thank Heaven! he will be married
soon."</p>

<p>"Have you told Mary that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but she laughs and
shrugs her shoulders; evidently
thinks she knows more about
Lincoln Todd's intentions than
I do."</p>

<p>In the last week of August Mr.
Todd went off for a few days "on
business," and then there came a
dreadful morning when the announcement
of his marriage to
Dolly Martin appeared in the
<i>Echo</i>.</p>

<p>Mary would not believe her
ears. She took the paper down
to the beach, and spelled out the
notice word by word. Then she
lay down on the sand and bawled,
kicking and squealing like a year-old
infant when Belle appealed to
her self-respect.</p>

<p>"I could have spanked her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
well," said my wife. The worst
of it was that the whole hotel was
"on to the racket," as Watty
vulgarly expressed it, and rather
chuckled over Belle's mortification,
instead of sympathizing with
her in the trying time she was
having with her "adopted daughter."</p>

<p>Our grief, as a family, was not
unbearable when the time came
in September for Mary Mason to
go back to the convent.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">T</span>he</span> self-assertive sleigh-bells
suddenly ceased
their tinkling, and the
long covered van, with
its four horses, drew up
in front of our "House of Many
Gables," in Lake City. Watty,
then a tall lad of eighteen, over-coated,
fur-capped, and gloved,
went quickly out, banging the
front door after him, while his
younger brothers and sisters made
holes with their breath through
the frost on the window panes,
to watch his departure with the
hilarious load of young folks.</p>

<p>"Why aint you goin', Mame?"
asked Joe, our smallest son, of the
girl spending her Christmas holidays
with us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't asked," she replied defiantly.
"An' what's more, I don't
care to go anywheres, neither, if
the girls don't act better to me
than they done at that party the
other night."</p>

<p>Belle raised her head from the
Treasurer's book of the House of
Refuge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you weren't nice to
them, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was too. I smiled
whenever one of them looked at
me, but they all turned their heads
as if they'd never seen me before."</p>

<p>My wife sighed as she bent
over her book again. If the difficulty
of befriending Mary rested
only with outsiders it might have
been patiently borne, but there
was mother, to whom the girl's
presence in the house was a constant
grievance.</p>

<p>I had been able to buy a quiet
horse and a Mikado cutter for
Belle when the snow came, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had no pleasure out of them during
the vacation.</p>

<p>"I'm going to drive downtown,
mother," I heard her say one
morning. "Would you like to
go?"</p>

<p>"Is Mary gaun?"</p>

<p>"I thought of taking her."</p>

<p>"Then I'll no' gang. I wadna
like to crood Mary."</p>

<p>"Dear mother, there's plenty
of room."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, but ye ken Mary
doesna like tae sit wi' her back tae
the horse."</p>

<p>That sort of thing was always
happening. One day the old lady
came home from a round of visits,
much perturbed in mind and body.
The sandy hair I inherited, and
have largely lost, does not show
the gray with which it is mixed,
and so light and wiry is she one
finds it difficult to remember my
mother's seventy years. She is a
small woman, but her personality
is sufficiently large for the ripples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to be felt throughout the household
when its surface is disturbed.</p>

<p>"What dae ye think I've been
hearin'?" she cried, finding me
alone in the nursery on the sofa,
and helpless in her hands.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine, mother. You
generally have something spicy to
tell us after you've been calling on
the MacTavishes."</p>

<p>"Dae ye ken 'at yon hizzy ye've
ta'en intill yer hoose ca's hersel'
Mary <i>Gemmell</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, what's in a name?"</p>

<p>"I wonner tae hear ye, Davvit!
What wad yer faither hae thocht
aboot it, or yer gran'faither?
Gie'n the femly name, that's come
doon unspotted frae ae generation
till anither, tae a funnlin' aff the
streets! Ou, ay! I micht 'a'
kent what wad happen when I
h'ard tell o' ye bein' merrit till an
Amerrican."</p>

<p>"Hold up there, mother.
You're just twenty years too late
in raking up that story. If it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
suits me and Belle to have that
girl called 'Mary Gemmell,' Mary
Gemmell she shall be, if it turns
all Scotland head over heels into
the North Sea."</p>

<p>So seldom do I break out that
an eruption of mine never fails
to clear the air of an unwelcome
topic.</p>

<p>Our boys have grown up on a
sort of an "every-man-for himself"
principle, and when it came
to a fight for the favorite corner
of the sofa, the favorite game, or
picture-book, "Mamie" was in the
thick of it every time.</p>

<p>"What else can you expect?"
said I to Belle, consolingly.
"She's been fighting the world on
her own account ever since she
can remember, and our house
represents to her only a change of
battle ground."</p>

<p>"I think her father must have
been a gentleman."</p>

<p>"He certainly had one gentlemanly
peculiarity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be a brute, Dave. I
mean that Mary's ancestors must
have been wealthy people, she has
such a taste for luxury."</p>

<p>"That doesn't follow. I'm sure
you've seen plenty of poor folks
go without the necessaries of life
in order to get the luxuries."</p>

<p>"She is shiftless enough. To-day
I took her into a store to buy
her some stockings, and she refused
to have any but the very
best quality. 'The second best
are what I get for myself, Mary,'
said I; 'they wear much longer
than the others.' 'I don't care,'
she said. 'If I can't have the
best, I don't want any.' 'Then
do without,' said I, and we left
the place. The fun of it is that
she won't even darn her old ones!
I can't always be so firm with her.
I'm amazed at myself sometimes,
the things she gets out of me.
What do you suppose she wants
now?"</p>

<p>I gave a warning cough to sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>nify
that my mother had come
into the nursery, but Belle gazed
straight ahead into the wood fire,
and seesawed in the rattan
rocker&mdash;a tuneful symphony in a
mauve tea-gown.</p>

<p>"A cornet, if you please."</p>

<p>"A cornet!" said I. "Whatever
put that into her head?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell. She says the
music professor at the convent can
teach her to play it, and she thinks
if she learned she might be able to
lead the singing in a church with
one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps somebody played the
cornet in that concert company
she was with."</p>

<p>"Na, na. It's nearer hame than
that," mother struck in. "She
has a notion o' ane o' thae cratur's
'at pl'y at the Opera Hoose. I
hae seen her gang by the window
wi' him, an' spiered at Watty wha
he was."</p>

<p>"I don't like Wat's telling tales
of Mary."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"He dinna, Davvit, till I pit it
tae him. He canna bear the
tawpie, and doesna like to hae her
p'inted oot as his sister. A body
canna blame the laddie. It's a
heap better than his fa'in' in luv
wi' her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," groaned Isabel.</p>

<p>When mother had gone to bed
my wife said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wade has been here to-day
to ask Watty and Mary to a
young people's dance on Friday
night."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I told her I wasn't going to
dress that girl up and send her out
to parties to be snubbed and
slighted by the other girls, as she
was at the dancing school ball.
She said that if I let Mary go
she'd see that she had a good
time. For her part, she admired
the way I'd stuck up for the girl
in spite of everything; and if she
was good enough to live with us
as a daughter, it would surely not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
contaminate anybody else to meet
her out of an evening."</p>

<p>Saturday night I inquired of
Belle how Mary got on at the
party.</p>

<p>"First rate. Mrs. Wade met
her at the door of the drawing
room and kissed her. 'How
you've grown, Mary!' said she,
and then she took her round
and introduced her to all the girls
in the room, including some of
those who've been cutting her
right and left, as well as to every
boy she didn't know already.
Of course she danced every
dance, and had the best time
going."</p>

<p>"And, of course, she put it all
down to her own superior attractions?"</p>

<p>"Just exactly. This morning
she didn't want to help me make
the beds!"</p>

<p>Mary's Christmas present had
been a beautiful silver-plated cornet,
and of course she must learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to play it when she went back to
the convent. Word came shortly
that the music master employed
there could not undertake to
teach her to play the instrument,
but that a "professor" could be
secured to go out from Detroit
twice a week&mdash;if desired. We
seemed to be in for it, so the
lessons were desired, and we comforted
ourselves with the assurance
that if Mary did not turn out
to be a tiptop reciter she would
surely prove a tiptop cornet
player. Her unusual talent would
justify my wife in her unusual
step, and the society of Lake
City would forgive her for attempting
to thrust the girl into its
midst as an equal. Many of our
acquaintances seemed to take
mother's view of the case,&mdash;"Matter
out of place becomes <i>dirrt</i>!"&mdash;and
Belle was put on her mettle
to convince the majority that she
had done exactly the right thing
in thus disclassing people. Dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>classing
people? In a free
republic!</p>

<p>We received glowing accounts
of the cornet lessons.</p>

<p>"Dear girl!" said Belle enthusiastically.
"She must have the
real artistic temperament to be
so determined to excel in one or
other of the arts."</p>

<p>"She's dramatic, anyway," said
I, and I was confirmed in my
opinion along in the spring, when
the cornet, and aught else, appeared
to have palled upon the
versatile Mary. She wrote that
she had serious thoughts of taking
the veil.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said I; "what's she
after now? She wants to scare
us into something."</p>

<p>Belle wrote privately to the
Lady Superior, telling her that if
she considered Mary would be a
desirable acquisition to their ranks
she had no sort of objection to
her joining them.</p>

<p>The good sister replied that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Miss Gemmell had not a grain of
the stuff of which nuns are made,
that her leanings were all in a
worldly direction.</p>

<p>"No hope in that quarter!"
laughed I, but Belle chided me
for making fun of Mary in her
absence.</p>

<p>When "Miss Mamie Gemmell"
joined us at Interlaken for the
summer her convent manners
lasted for about two weeks, and
then gave place to those of a
spoiled and pampered daughter
of the house.</p>

<p>We in America are accustomed
to disrespectfulness and waywardness
in our own children, but to
notice the same attitude in a little
nobody from nowhere we have
taken in out of charity, makes a
man or woman stand aghast.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she cares a
straw for me personally," Belle
would say sometimes, "but I
must confess I like her better
than the cringing, fawning variety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
She's outspoken in her impertinent
demands."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After a very hot week in July I
joyfully took the train on Saturday
afternoon for the five miles'
ride to Interlaken, and went to
sleep that night with my ears
full of the sound of waves and
pine trees; my heart filled with
the satisfaction of knowing that I
had a whole round day ahead of
me&mdash;a sunrise and a sunset at
either end.</p>

<p>I omitted the sunrise part of
the programme, but between ten
and eleven I was ready for a walk
down the pier to watch the
bathers. American women are
seldom plump enough to stand
the undress uniform of a bathing
costume. They run to extremes&mdash;become
very stout indeed, or
else very thin, but in girlhood
the tendency is to over-slimness.</p>

<p>I was thinking what a contrast
our summer girls would present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to a group of Scotch lasses,
though, to be sure, I was never
privileged to see any of the latter
in bathing-dress, when a well-rounded
apparition in sky blue
luster and no bathing cap emerged
from one of the disrobing houses.
This damsel betook herself boldly
to the pier, instead of splashing
around the edge of the sand as
the others were doing, and, coming
near the end, took a run and
then a beautiful header into the
deep blue water.</p>

<p>She had passed me too quickly
to be recognized, but as her face
appeared above the surface I saw
it belonged to no other than our
adopted daughter, for as such, at
the moment, was I pleased to own
her. She shook the water out of
her ears, gave her knob of hair an
extra twist, brushed back the ringlets
that threatened her eyes, and
looked as much at home as if there
were eighteen feet of land, instead
of eighteen feet of water below her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>There were several young men
swimming about at the end of the
wharf, and they declared with
gusto that a springboard must be
erected for "Miss Gemmell" at
once. I declined to assist in
breaking the Sabbath over any
such pranks, but a couple of
scantily clad, dripping youths
arose from the deep and succeeded
in loosening a heavy three-inch
plank from the flooring of
the wharf. This was projected
well out over the water, and the
fair Mary was induced to ascend
and exhibit therefrom. I did not
approve at all, but thought it my
duty to remain as chaperon until
Belle and another lady, whom I
perceived walking leisurely out the
pier, should arrive.</p>

<p>The young men sprang back
into the water to be on the reception
committee, and Mary teetered
on the far end of the plank.
There was heard a loud, suggestive
<i>crack</i>, and she leaped into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
space in a most graceful semicircle
before touching the water; but
that awful board, the instant her
weight was removed, rose straight
up in the air, nearly knocked me
off the dock, and with a groan slid
through the opening whence it
had been raised, into the depths
below.</p>

<p>Belle rushed to my rescue, while
the other woman stood still and
shrieked.</p>

<p>"Nobody hurt!" called out
from the water a nice-looking lad
who was swimming beside Mary,
and apparently daring her to
further exploits.</p>

<p>"Who is the young man?" I
asked my wife, being ready to
change the subject from my own
narrow escape.</p>

<p>"You mean the one with the
Burne Jones head and the sleepy
blue eyes that's round with Mary
all the time? His name's Flaker,
and he's a medical student from
Chicago. That's all I know about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
him." But she was destined to
hear more, as we sat on the hotel
veranda that night, from two old
ladies inside the open window and
closed blind.</p>

<p>"Isn't it scandalous," said one,
"the way Mrs. Gemmell tries to
shove that girl forward on every
occasion?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other. "The
old friendship between her and
Mrs. Martin is all broken up since
she tried so hard to get Lincoln
Todd entangled with her last
summer, and now she's doing her
best to catch young Flaker."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he has any idea
who the girl is, or rather who she
is not."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, and his people
would be in a great state if they
knew the sort of company he was
keeping."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? His father
is Dr. Flaker, who has that fine
mansion on the Grand Boule<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>vard,
and his mother belongs to
one of the best New York families.
They're all as proud as
Lucifer."</p>

<p>"I think it is time we went
home, David. Listeners never
hear any good of themselves,"
said Belle, loudly enough to arrest
the attention of the two
dames.</p>

<p>Walking over the dried-up
moonlit grass to our cottage, I
threatened to go back and give
them a piece of my mind, but my
wife said:</p>

<p>"Maybe I did need a slight
reminder. I haven't paid much
attention to Mary's goings-on this
summer. I must talk to Mr.
Flaker the first chance."</p>

<p>The opportunity came before
the Evening was over, while I
was in my pet hammock round
the corner of the cottage, and
Belle in a rocking-chair at the
front.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Flaker," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
heard her say. "I don't think
you've ever seen the inside of
our cottage. Won't you step in
for a moment, now that it is
lighted up?"</p>

<p>The moment satisfied him, for
he speedily returned to the
veranda.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a beautiful
swimmer as Miss Gemmell," said
the mannish voice, and Belle
replied impressively:</p>

<p>"I believe you are not aware,
Mr. Flaker, that the young lady
you call Miss Gemmell is not my
own daughter."</p>

<p>"Your stepchild is she, or your
husband's niece?"</p>

<p>"Neither. She is no relation
at all&mdash;just a poor girl whom I
have taken up to educate. She
can barely read or write. I felt
that I ought to tell you this because
you have been paying her
a good deal of attention."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mrs. Gemmell, I admire
Miss Gemmell very much;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but I assure you I never regarded
her as anything else than a pleasant
summer acquaintance."</p>

<p>And Mary was dropped forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">T</span>he</span> winter of 1892-93
Mary spent at home
with us. Her first expressed
wish, when the
family returned from
Interlaken, was to be confirmed,
and the Rev. Mr. Armstrong of
the church we do not attend was
duly notified.</p>

<p>"He says I must be christened
first," said Mary. "Would you
mind if he called me 'Mary Gemmell'?
There aint any name
that I've a right to, and I don't
want to be called 'Mason,' because
that's the name of the
woman that abused me when
I was little. I'd rather have
yours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>She was such a pathetic-looking
young person, standing there
before Belle in her fresh and
innocent loveliness, that my wife
had not the heart to refuse her
anything.</p>

<p>When I came home that same
evening there was a <i>tableau
vivant</i> in front of the parlor fire.
Dressed in white, Mary sat on a
low stool at the feet of the Rev.
Walter Armstrong, her hands
clasped in her lap, gazing up into
the clean-shaven clerical face, with
that which passed for her soul in
her eyes. In spite of his stiff
round collar and long black coat
the rector is a young man, and I
saw that he was impressed.</p>

<p>"You understand, do you,
Mary," he said tenderly, "that
when you are received into the
Church you have God for your
Father and Christ for your Elder
Brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, Mr. Armstrong,"
replied the girl earnestly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
"And that's just what I always
wanted&mdash;was to have <i>'folks.'</i>"</p>

<p>I retired in haste to the dining
room, where Isabel was brimming
over with a new scheme.</p>

<p>"I've always found the housekeeping
a drag, and it becomes
more so every year as my outlook
broadens. I want to keep up to
the times, but I never have any
leisure for reading, and our four
eldest being boys, there seemed
to be no hope for years of having
any one to relieve me."</p>

<p>"Mary's a godsend," said I.</p>

<p>"I wish you really thought
that, as I do. She's quick and
adaptable, and I'm going to hand
over to her a weekly allowance
and let her keep the house
on it."</p>

<p>"What about her accomplishments&mdash;the
elocution and the
cornet?"</p>

<p>"They can stand in the meantime.
Do you know, Davie,"
hesitatingly, "I'm beginning to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
be afraid she hasn't a good ear
for music."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The other night when the
Mortons were in she sat and
talked to Frank Wade the whole
time Eva was playing."</p>

<p>"That's nothing. Everyone
else did the same."</p>

<p>"But for a girl who is trying
to pose as a cornet player, who
thinks she might earn her living
leading a church choir with one,
it's bad policy, to say the least
of it."</p>

<p>"Earn her living! I asked Joe
Mitchell, when he was listening to
her practicing out in the summer-house,
what he thought of her
playing, and he said she'd better
keep to a penny whistle."</p>

<p>"Very rude of him!"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't. I asked him
point blank if I should be justified
in paying for the more lessons
she wants, and he said decidedly
I should not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Belle wearily,
"we'll try the housekeeping.
That's a woman's true vocation,
according to orthodox ideas. I
shouldn't have set my heart on
Mary turning out to be anything
extraordinary. If she'll only be
kind of half decent, and help me
out with the housework, I'll be
more than satisfied."</p>

<p>The sense of power gave new
brightness to Mary's fair face, and
her step through the house was of
the lightest during the next week
or two, but the boys rebelled in
turn.</p>

<p>"<i>Mam</i>ma! Mary's locked the
pantry. Must we go to her for
the key whenever we want anything?"</p>

<p>"I call it a mean shame!" from
Joe.</p>

<p>"What were you doing?"</p>

<p>"We didn't do nothin', on'y eat
up the pie she meant for dessert.
I'm sure Margaret wouldn't mind
makin' another."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mary's perfectly right, boys;
I've indulged you too much."</p>

<p>Then it was Watty who complained:</p>

<p>"Mary says she won't have us
mussing up the parlor after she's
tidied it, and that we've got to
change our boots when we come
into the house." Or Chrissie:</p>

<p>"Mary says I'm big enough now
to keep my own room in order,
and she aint going to do it any
more. She's wors'en grandma!"</p>

<p>To their grandma did they go
with their woes when they found
their mother so unaccountably
obdurate, but they did not get
much comfort there. Detest
Mary as she might, my poor
mother is always loyal to the
powers that be, and she told the
children:</p>

<p>"Yer mither kens fine what
she's aboot, an' ye needna fash
yer heids tae come cryin' tae me."</p>

<p>She even went so far as to back
Mary up in her suggestion that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the boys should eat what was set
before them, asking no questions.</p>

<p>"That's the w'y yer faither was
brocht up. If he didna finish his
parritch in the mornin', they were
warmed up for him again at nicht.
Ye tak' but a spinfu' 'at ye could
hardly ca' parritch, for they're jist
puzhioned wi' sugar."</p>

<p>Mary was not naturally fond of
children, and, having entered our
family full-grown, she found it
hard to put up with the freaks of
our six, there being no foundation
of sisterly love upon which to
build toleration.</p>

<p>Belle's housekeeping had always
been lavish. She ordered her
groceries wholesale, and when
they were done never inquired
what had become of them.</p>

<p>"I decline to go into details&mdash;life
is too short! I don't know
where my patience ends and my
laziness begins, but I'd rather be
cheated than lock things up, or
try to keep track of what Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>garet
wastes. She's not an ideal
'general,' but it's only one in a
hundred that would stand the
children pottering about in the
kitchen so much."</p>

<p>After the time-worn custom of
new brooms, Mary made a bold
attempt to record each item of
expenditure, and ordered what
she wanted from day to day; but
there was no calculating the
appetites of four growing boys,
especially when, as Mary affirmed,
they sometimes over-ate themselves
just to spite her.</p>

<p>"We're living from hand to
mouth, <i>pa</i>pa," they would say,
when an unwonted scarcity occurred.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I began to sympathize
with my revolting sons
when I brought an old friend
home with me to dinner one day,
and went to announce the fact to
our "housekeeper."</p>

<p>"I just wish that Bob Mansell
would quit coming here so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
when he's not expected. There's
only enough pudding for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Mary," said I sternly, "Mr.
Mansell's been coming to this
house before you were here, and
he'll keep on coming after you're
gone, if you're not careful."</p>

<p>It was the first time I had ever
spoken sharply to her, and I
flattered myself that I had done
some good, though she held her
head high and left the room.</p>

<p>Belle came to the conclusion
that the housekeeping scheme did
not work smoothly, and she resumed
the reins of government.
Mary was still supposed to do the
work of a second maid, but it
was evident that her heart was
not in it.</p>

<p>"What does Mary want now?"
I asked my wife when she took
her usual seat beside me, as I lay
on the sofa with my pipe.</p>

<p>"She thinks she'd like to go to
the Boston School of Oratory to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
prepare herself to be a public
reader."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary that she should
be before the public in one way or
another?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem to be much
of a success in private life."</p>

<p>"In that respect she's no worse
than half the girls in town. None
of them dote on housework."</p>

<p>"But, considering that this girl
has no earthly claim on us, you'd
think she might be different."</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, Belle, at my
saying so, but you've only yourself
to thank for that. You've
been most anxious that Mary
should be just like one of ourselves&mdash;should
not feel that she
was accepting charity, and you've
succeeded only too well. The
girl takes everything you do for
her as her right, and asks for
more."</p>

<p>"Well, what about Boston?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be arrant
folly to send her there. How do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
we know she has any more talent
for elocution than for music?"</p>

<p>"She has the desire to learn.
I suppose that's a sign of the
ability."</p>

<p>"She has an intense desire for
admiration, that's about the size
of it. To be the center of all
eyes, giving a recitation in a drawing
room, pleases her down to the
ground, but it doesn't follow that
she would be a success professionally."</p>

<p>"I dare say we've spent about
as much on her education as you
care to do just now."</p>

<p>"We have indeed!"</p>

<p>My wife and I are much in demand
at all the social functions of
our town, and, though I accompany
her under protest, I confess
that, once the affair is in full
swing, I enjoy as much as anybody
a hand at "Pedro" or a
dance.</p>

<p>The houses of our city are
mostly wooden and mostly new,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for an annual conflagration keeps
building brisk. Hardwood floors
and mantels are the order of the
day, and if some of our lumbermen
and their wives have not a
command of English grammar in
keeping with their horses, their
sealskins, and their diamonds, they
have a heartier than an English
welcome&mdash;except, of course, for
guests of such questionable antecedents
as our Mary.</p>

<p>Mrs. David Gemmell is a bright
and witty woman, though I say it,
who should not. But why should
I not? She did not inherit her
wits from me. Mrs. David Gemmell
let the leading ladies of the
town understand that unless Mary
was invited to everything that was
going on, we stayed away ourselves.
Lake City society could
not proceed without Isabel, so the
"white elephant" was received
in her train, and truly she did us
credit in company, if nowhere
else. She was always stylishly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dressed, and her dancing was a
joy forever. We did not marvel
when Will Axworthy, the most
eligible young man about, took it
into his head to introduce the
german to our benighted citizens,
that he chose Mary for his partner
to lead it with him. She had private
lessons from himself, as well
as from the dancing master, and
proud and happy were Belle and I
to sit at the side of the ballroom
and watch her going through the
figures and bestowing her favors
with all the grace and dignity of
one of the four hundred.</p>

<p>"She shall go to Boston to-morrow,
if she wants to," said I,
but this time Belle demurred.</p>

<p>"I think she seems likely to
have a good time here this winter,
and we may as well let her have
her fling."</p>

<p>The prophecy was fulfilled. In
spite of the supreme jealousy of
the other girls, who could not say
mean enough things about her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Mary became quite the rage with
the young men.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon Will
Axworthy called. He is short
and broad, has reddish hair and a
chronic blush hardly to be looked
for in the Ward McAllister of
Lake City. Too nervously did he
plant himself in my frisky spring
rocker, and therefore involuntarily
did he present the soles of his
boots to the assembled family,
while his head bumped the wall,
to the huge delight of our boys!</p>

<p>Undaunted by that inauspicious
beginning, he came again the next
Sunday, smoked my best cigars,
and talked lumber, the one subject
upon which he is posted, for
he was the manager of a mill here.</p>

<p>He stayed to supper that evening
and went with Mary to church
afterward. Then he called for her
with a cutter the first bright day,
and took her sleigh riding. The
embryo wrinkle left Belle's forehead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really think he means
anything?" said she.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sanguine about
it. Nowadays, young men pay a
girl a great deal of attention with
nothing in their heads but a good
time."</p>

<p>"Still, Axworthy's no boy.
He's thirty if he's a day, and he
has a good salary, and can afford
to marry whenever the mood takes
him."</p>

<p>"Let us hope and pray that it
may take him soon!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Belle solemnly.</p>

<p>The daily friction with her
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> was becoming too much
for the good-natured patience even
of my better half. Acting upon
generous impulses is all very fine,
but they need to be backed up by
a large amount of endurance and
tolerance if the results are to be
successfully dealt with.</p>

<p>From my vantage-ground on
the nursery sofa, behind my screen
of newspaper, I frequently hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
more than is suspected by the
family.</p>

<p>"Mary, you're not going to the
rink to-night!" in Belle's most
imploring tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, mawm, I am. Lend me
your wrench, Watty."</p>

<p>"Mary, I positively forbid you
to go to the rink!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do think that's just
too mean for anything. Every
girl in town goes."</p>

<p>"Every girl in town doesn't
skate with barber, or bandsman,
or anybody who comes along, as
you do."</p>

<p>"Watty's been telling!"</p>

<p>"Watty hasn't been telling!"
broke in our eldest son in indignant
protest, which he further
emphasized by going out and
banging the door after him.</p>

<p>"And, Mary," Belle continued,
"are you engaged to Mr. Axworthy?"</p>

<p>"No!" sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then if I were you I wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
let him kiss me when he says
'Good-night' at the door after
bringing you home from a party."</p>

<p>"You're old-fashioned. All the
girls do it!"</p>

<p>"No <i>lady</i> would permit a man
to take such a liberty. You're
spoiling your chances with Mr.
Axworthy, I can tell you. I
never knew a man yet that would
bind himself to a girl when he
could have all the privileges of an
engaged man, and none of the
responsibilities."</p>

<p>"I don't care anything at all
about him. I don't want to marry
him. He's just giving me a good
time."</p>

<p>A good time he undoubtedly
did give her throughout the winter.
To the smartest balls and
parties he was her escort, and she
always wore the roses he never
neglected to send. Every Sunday
about dusk he would come
round to our house, and, martyrs
to a good cause, Isabel, mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and I vacated the cozy parlor with
its easy chairs and blazing fire for
the nursery&mdash;always uproarious
with children on that day.</p>

<p>"I wonder what those two find
to talk about," speculated Belle.
"Mary has no conversation at all,
and Axworthy hasn't much more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he takes it out in
looking at her. By the way, Belle,
when are you going to appear in
the new dress I gave you that
fifty dollars to buy? I am quite
tired of the mauve tea gown."</p>

<p>My wife glanced over her
shoulder to make sure that
Grandma was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"The truth is, Dave, I thought
I must wait to see how much of
it I had left after getting Mary
rigged up for the Robinsons'
dance. She goes out so often
that she needs a change of evening
dress."</p>

<p>"Did she ask for it?"</p>

<p>"Not directly, but she remarked
that she didn't see what I wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with a new black silk, that I had
plenty of clothes, and that when
she was my age she didn't think
she'd bother about what she had
to wear."</p>

<p>I sprang up from the sofa,
prepared to shove Mary out of the
house, neck and crop, but Belle's
outburst of laughter calmed me.</p>

<p>"Her cheek is so great that it
passes from the ridiculous to the
sublime!"</p>

<p>"Why do you stand it, Belle?
You wouldn't from anybody else."</p>

<p>"I can't very well go back on
her at this stage, and send her
about her business. She's shrewd
enough to know that."</p>

<p>"People would laugh; that's
so!"</p>

<p>"Besides, if she marries Axworthy,
she'll be our social equal
here in this town, and it must
never be in her power to say that
we did not treat her well."</p>

<p>"What is the prospect with
Axworthy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, I think. He is
thoroughly kind to her, and he
has given me plenty of hints
about the state of his affections,
hopes by another winter that
Mary will have somebody else to
look after her, and so on. He is
always most particular in seeing
that she is well wrapped up, and
that is highly necessary, for she is
extremely careless about how she
goes out. In spite of a certain
amount of physical dash, she isn't a
bit strong; has no staying power."</p>

<p>"It won't be much fun for
Axworthy to be saddled with a
delicate wife."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he needs some
discipline, just as much as I do.
I've had my share out of Miss
Mary for the last three years, and
I am quite willing to let somebody
else have a turn. He walks
into this thing with his eyes open.
He knows her history."</p>

<p>"But does he know her disposition?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let him find that out&mdash;if he
can. Most mothers don't think
it necessary to tell their daughters'
suitors how the girls get on with
them in the house."</p>

<p>"You say she has no constitution.
Supposing he does marry
her, how about the possible children?
What have they done that
they should have Mary for a
mother?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly the right way
to put it&mdash;what have they done?
We don't know, but they must
have gone far astray last time, if
they are given such a bad start
this incarnation."</p>

<p>Will Axworthy left town in the
spring. Lumber was done in our
part of Michigan and he had to
follow it further south. He and
Mary corresponded, for I caught
Belle in the act of correcting one
of her letters.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's quite fair
to Axworthy? If they become
engaged, the first unedited letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he gets from Mary will be considerable
of a surprise to him."</p>

<p>"Don't you bother your old
head, Dave! I'm running this
thing! He's arranging to meet
us in Chicago, and hopes to have
the pleasure of showing Mary the
Columbian Exhibition. Something
is sure to happen while
we're there!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">A</span>ll</span> winter we had been
talking about the Fair,
reading up about the
Fair, making plans for
the Fair; and Belle declared
that even if she never saw
the Fair she would be glad it had
been, on account of the amount
of preparatory information she
had laid up.</p>

<p>We did get off at last in the
end of June, the whole of us, including
Mary, of course&mdash;my first
experience of traveling in her
company. We went to Chicago
by boat,&mdash;a night's crossing,&mdash;and
a rare time I had securing berths
for the family in the overcrowded
propeller. I was thankful for an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"extension," a sort of shell run
out between two staterooms and
partitioned off by curtains and
poles. The boys had to sleep on
sofas, floor, anywhere, which to
them was but the beginning of
the fun.</p>

<p>The first of my Herculean
labors at an end, I was enjoying
my smoke aft in the cool of the
evening, when Belle came back to
me, her brow drawn up into what
I had begun to call the "Mary
wrinkle."</p>

<p>"David, I'm afraid you'll have
to talk to that girl. She's sitting
up in the bow there flirting with
one of the waiters, and though
I've sent Watty twice after her,
she won't stir."</p>

<p>As majestically as my five feet
four would permit, I moved to the
front of the boat.</p>

<p>"Mary, Mrs. Gemmell wants
you right away."</p>

<p>She took time to exchange a
laughing farewell with the good-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>looking
waiter, and explained to
me <i>en route</i>:</p>

<p>"That's Bill Moreland. I knew
him quite well in Lake City. I've
met him at balls."</p>

<p>In the morning before we
reached Chicago, she managed to
get in a long confabulation with
another waiter, whom I am sure
she had never met in Lake City,
nor anywhere else.</p>

<p>"See here, Mary! If this is the
way you're going to behave, you
go straight back to Lake City on
that boat, and don't see one bit
of the Fair."</p>

<p>Her manners were mended till
we were actually in Jackson Park,
but then:</p>

<p>"She's a philanthropist, Belle,
a lover of <i>man</i>kind&mdash;Columbian
Guard, Gospel Charioteer, Turk
in the bazaar. The creed or the
color doesn't matter so long as he
calls himself a man."</p>

<p>I am afraid I was cross, for it
did not take one day to realize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
what an undertaking it was going
to be to keep track of my family,
who had never before seemed too
numerous. Daily at 10 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, in
the Michigan Building, did I hand
over to Will Axworthy the most
troublesome of the lot, and daily
did I wish he would keep her for
better or worse.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July cannonading
began at daybreak, and
for once I sympathized in my
mother's objection to the license
accorded to young Americans.
They set off firecrackers, not by
the bunch but by the bushel;
kerosene and dynamite were their
ambrosia and nectar. What with
fighting for lunch in overcrowded
restaurants, and then retaliating
by stealing chairs out of the same,
hunting through the various
booths in the Midway to collect
my three younger sons when it
was time to send them home, and
rescuing my two little girls from
an over-supply of ice cream sodas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and chocolate drops, I did not
specially enjoy the glorious
Fourth.</p>

<p>Toward evening there was not
a foot of Fair ground undecorated
by a banana skin, a crust of
bread, or a flying paper. Belle
considered the signs "Keep off
the Grass" quite superfluous, and
pulling one up by the roots she
sat down on it, thereby keeping
the letter, if not the spirit of the
law.</p>

<p>"Now, Dave," said she, "the
family are all safe off the grounds,
and you can go and get a gondola
to come and take us for a sail before
dark. Everybody is moving
toward the lake front to wait for
the fireworks, and the lagoons are
not so crowded as they were.
Let's pretend we're on our honeymoon."</p>

<p>So seldom does Belle wax sentimental
over me, I hailed her proposition
with outward indifference
but inward joy. Securing a gon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>dola
to ourselves, in it we were
gently swayed through canal and
under bridge in the mystical evening
light.</p>

<p>The distant rumble of a train on
the Intramural, or a quack from
a sleepy duck among the rushes,
alone broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"This is where I belong!" exclaimed
Belle. "I've seen before
those Eastern-looking towers and
minarets, with the sunset glow on
the cloud masses behind them.
Look! there's a Turk and a Hindoo
crossing the bridge. This
is the region, this the soil, the
clime. I always knew I wasn't
meant for Western America."</p>

<p>"You must have been very
naughty <i>last time</i> to have been
raised in Michigan this trip. Still
this is only Chicago!"</p>

<p>"It's not Chicago! It's the
world! Listen to that now&mdash;the
music of the spheres!"</p>

<p>We approached another gondola
that had withdrawn itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from the center of the channel
close in to a small island. The
man at the stern was doing nothing
very picturesquely, but the
man at the bow, a swarthy Venetian,
was pouring out his soul in an
aria from "Cavalleria Rusticana."
His voice might not have passed
muster at Covent Garden, but in
the unique stage setting, which
included a group of eager listeners
on abridge behind him, one could
forgive a break on a high note or
two.</p>

<p>The singer threw himself into
the spirit of the composition, cast
his eyes upward with hand on his
heart, and bent them to earth
again for the approval of his passengers.
There were but two, a
young man and a young lady, and
to the latter was the hero in
costume directing his amorous
glances.</p>

<p>"There's romance for you!"
said I to Belle, who is notoriously
on the lookout for it. I directed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
our gondolier to draw nearer to
his enamoured compatriot. My
wife replied uneasily:</p>

<p>"I don't know the man, or boy,
for that's all he is, but if that isn't
Mary's hat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary! Phew! What's become
of Axworthy?"</p>

<p>As we approached the comfortable-looking
pair, Mary bowed to
us smilingly, and called the attention
of her companion to her
"father and mother"&mdash;darn her
impudence!</p>

<p>The boat ride was spoiled for
Belle and me, our white elephant
having arisen to haunt us once
more. We landed and walked
over to the lake front, where the
whole slope was packed with
people waiting for the fireworks
to begin.</p>

<p>Someone started to sing "Way
Down upon the Swanee Ribber,"
and everybody joined in.
"Nearer, my God, to Thee" was
also most impressive from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
vast impromptu chorus. In the
foreground Lake Michigan lay
darkly expectant, with a large
black cloud upon its horizon,
though the stars shone overhead.
A half-circle of boats extended
from the long Exhibition Wharf
on the right, round to the warship
<i>Illinois</i> on the left, and from
the latter a search light, an omnipresent
eye, swept the crowd with
rapidly veering glance, till it concentrated
its gaze on the dark
balloon which rose so mysteriously
from the water. Suddenly from
this balloon was suspended the
Stars and Stripes in colored lights.
The crowd cheered like mad, the
boats whistled, and sent up
rockets galore.</p>

<p>On went the programme.
Bombs tested the strength of our
wearied ear-drums, fiery snakes
sizzled through the air, big wheels
spurted brilliant marvels, and
along the very edge of the lake, to
the great discomfort of the front<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rows of the stalls, a line of combustibles
behaved like gigantic
footlights on a spree.</p>

<p>"David, who do you suppose
that was with Mary?"</p>

<p>I had been up in the air with
George Washington, surrounded
by "First in War, First in Peace,
etc.," in letters of fire, and I was
unwillingly recalled to earth.</p>

<p>"Haven't the remotest idea.
Hope she hasn't given Axworthy
the slip."</p>

<p>"I'm only hoping that he has
not given her the slip. I'd never
have brought her to the Fair if he
hadn't agreed to look after her."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a
surging of the mighty crowd,
caused by a band of college
students pushing their way
through, shoulder to shoulder,
singing one of their rousing ditties.
Some people who had been standing
on their hired rolling chairs
had narrow escapes from being
flung upon the shoulders of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in front. Some did not escape&mdash;Mary
for instance, who landed
between us as if shot from a catapult.</p>

<p>"I knew I was going to fall, so
I just jumped to where I seen you
two," said she, with her customary
calmness, and then she turned to
assure her escort of the gondola,
who was anxiously elbowing his
way to her, that she was entirely
unhurt.</p>

<p>Blushing prettily, she introduced
the lad as "Mr. Tom
Axworthy&mdash;cousin of the Mr. Axworthy
you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Tom talked to Mrs. Gemmell
with the ease and assurance
of ninety rather than nineteen,
while I exchanged a few words
aside with the maiden:</p>

<p>"Where is the Mr. Axworthy
that we know?"</p>

<p>"He had some business to do in
town to-night, so he left me in
charge of this cousin of his&mdash;just a
lovely fellow!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! Introduced you to
any more of his relations?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;an uncle; quite an
old bachelor, but lovely too!"</p>

<p>"And I suppose you've been
round with the uncle as well."</p>

<p>"Not very much. He was to
have taken me up in the balloon
yesterday, but the cyclone
burst it."</p>

<p>"We're going home now, and I
think you'd better say 'Good-night'
to Mr. Tom Axworthy and
come with us."</p>

<p>After waiting two hours and a
half for standing room on a suburban
train, we reached the hotel
at an early hour on July the 5th,
dusty, smoke-stained, and powder-scented,
like veterans from a field
of battle.</p>

<p>That was not by any means
the last of Mr. Tom Axworthy.
During the remainder of our stay
in Chicago it was he quite as frequently
as his more mature and
eligible cousin who exchanged a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
lingering farewell with Mary at
the ladies' entrance to our hotel,
and a great fear arose in the heart
of Belle that the young woman
was fooling away her time with
this impecunious boy, instead of
making the most of her opportunities
to come to a satisfactory
understanding with his cousin.
Every morning did she gaze
pathetically into my face, saying:</p>

<p>"I do hope Axworthy will propose
to-day!" and once she
added:</p>

<p>"I cannot face another winter
in the same house with that girl
and your mother. Grandma has
taken it into her head that Mary
is my pet lamb, the idol of my
heart, for whom she, and you too,
have been set aside. She doesn't
see that it worries me half to
death to have Mary tagging
round after me the whole time,
and overrunning the house with
her beaux. Neither of our own
girls is old enough yet, thank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
goodness, to consider herself my
companion and equal, to wear my
gloves, my boots, my best hairpins,
and to use my favorite perfume;
to come and plant herself
down beside me whenever I'm
talking confidentially to anyone,
to be determined to have her
finger into every pie, to know
what I'm reading or thinking
about. She'll insist on knowing
my dreams next!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mesmerize her."</p>

<p>"If I did, I'd make her keep
away from me! I could stand
it all better if I thought she
really cared a straw for me, but
I have the feeling that she regards
me merely as a basis for
supplies."</p>

<p>"We can only trust, then, that
the basis may be speedily transferred
to Axworthy!"</p>

<p>On our return from the World's
Fair, the family stopped off at
Interlaken, but I had to go on
into town to the <i>Echo</i> office. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
my surprise, Mary joined me at
my solitary dinner at the "House
of the Seven Gables," where Margaret,
as usual, was in charge, and
she remained there for the rest of
the week.</p>

<p>"Where's Mary?" was Belle's
greeting, when I joined her on
Saturday.</p>

<p>"She's in town."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring her out
with you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know you wanted her.
She said she'd like to stay in Lake
City over Sunday, to take the
Communion."</p>

<p>"Take the Communion indeed!
She wants to be left there alone
with Margaret, so that she'll have
a chance to flirt with every man
in town. I thought you had more
sense, David."</p>

<p>I pulled my soft felt hat further
over my diminished head.</p>

<p>"Did she get any letters?"</p>

<p>"One or two."</p>

<p>"Wretch! I told her to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out here with you to-night for
certain."</p>

<p>Monday morning, mother, who
had been spending the summer
with my married sister in Lake
City, came out to stay for a week
with us at Interlaken.</p>

<p>She could hardly wait till the
youngsters were out of hearing to
pour her story into my ears. I
had to take back to town the
train by which she had come out,
but she made the most of her
time.</p>

<p>"There's been great doin's in
yer hoose in yer absence. Marg'et
's been tellin' yer sister's servant
a' aboot Mary's luv affairs.
Mary tell't her 'at Eesabelle bade
her write Willum Axworthy an'
spier his intentions; that if she
didna, Mrs. Davvit said she'd d'it
hersel'. An' a' the time she's correspondin'
wi' a yunger ane, an
Axworthy tae, 'at she tells Marg'et
she likes a hape better. Yer
sister's sair affronted to think o'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the w'y the fem'ly name's bein'
cairted thro' the mire."</p>

<p>Belle came out on the veranda,
her broad hat in her hand, ready
to walk down to the train with
me.</p>

<p>"So Axworthy didn't propose
at the Fair?" said I, when we were
out of earshot of the cottage.</p>

<p>"No; and I think it's a crying
shame, too, after the way he appropriated
the girl all last winter,
and in Chicago too."</p>

<p>"A great relief to you! Well,
I guess the whole town knows by
this time that you made Mary
write and ask his intentions."</p>

<p>"This is too much! Has your
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary's been making a <i>confidante</i>
of Margaret, that's all.
That inestimable domestic is so
much one of ourselves, it was hard
for the unsophisticated mind to
know exactly where to draw the
line."</p>

<p>"I hope she has drawn the line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
at showing Margaret his reply. I
haven't seen that myself."</p>

<p>"What can you expect it to be?
If he had wanted to marry the
girl there was nothing to prevent
him asking her, and if he did not,
no letter of yours would make
him want to."</p>

<p>"She wrote it herself, and all
she said was that she would like
to know definitely how she stood
with him. I did nothing but correct
the spelling."</p>

<p>"Better if you had written in
your own name, and without her
knowledge. No daughter of the
house would ever have been put
in such a position. So far as I
can judge, Mary and Mr. Will
Axworthy are quits. If he has
had a good time in her society,
she has had an equally good time
in his, and he does not enjoy her
letters so much as he did her propinquity."</p>

<p>"He's a cold-hearted, cowardly&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tut! tut! my dear!"</p>

<p>By this time we were on the
platform, and the engine was
backing its one car down to receive
me and the other unhappy
toilers compelled to go away and
leave that sapphire-blue lake behind.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Isabel, that
it's about time you quit trying to
play Providence and gave God a
chance?"</p>

<p>"Dave! you're blasphemous!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I only wish to
remark that in your schemes for
the welfare of one particular
person, you are apt to overlook
the comfort and happiness of
everyone else concerned. That's
the worst of not being omniscient.
You're only an amateur sort of a
deity after all."</p>

<p>"Send that girl out here by the
very next train." And I obeyed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">A</span>nother</span> week of night
work, and then the sunniest
of Sundays on
the shore of old Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>I noticed that Mary was in deep
disgrace with my wife, who would
hardly speak to her, and I judged
therefore that Mr. Will Axworthy
had not been brought to time.</p>

<p>I am not a venturesome boatman,
and generally confine my
aquatic outings to the smaller lake,
but that Saturday night there was
not a breath of wind, and the
water was placidity personified, so
I drifted in my small skiff through
the channel that connects the
smaller with the larger body of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
water. On the sandy point jutting
out at the mouth, upon an old
stump, sat a solitary maiden, the
picture of woe.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mary!" said I, ignoring
the tears; "want to go for a
boat ride?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do," she
replied, seating herself in the stern,
which I turned toward her.</p>

<p>Silently I pulled out into the
big lake, where the copper-colored
sun going down in a haze near the
horizon bade us beware of a hot
day on the morrow. Out of the
lake to the right rose the full
moon, failing as yet to make her
gentle influence felt against the
radiant glow the sun was leaving
behind him.</p>

<p>"So Axworthy's gone back on
you, Mary?"</p>

<p>The fountains played again.</p>

<p>"Yes; and it aint the first time
I've got left, neither."</p>

<p>With Mrs. Mason, the Ferguson
Family, Lincoln Todd, and young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Flaker on the tablets of my mind,
I could truthfully assent to that
remark.</p>

<p>"Still, it may be just the making
of you in the long run."</p>

<p>"I'm not breakin' my heart over
Will Axworthy; didn't care nothing
'tall 'bout him, on'y I'd got
used havin' him round, and I'd
have married him if he asked me.
I think a sight more of his
cousin."</p>

<p>"The boy we saw at the Fair?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's written me a lovely
letter. Would you mind reading
it aloud to me? Some of the big
words I couldn't make out, and
neither could Margaret. I wrote
him all myself!"</p>

<p>Never before had it fallen to my
lot to play father confessor to a
lady in love difficulties, but the
editorial mind is equal to any
emergency, so I let my oars slide
and adjusted my reading-glasses
to peruse Mary's precious epistle.</p>

<p>When I had read on to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
signature. "Your devoted lover
'Tom,'" Mary's face was radiant.</p>

<p>"Aint he smart? You know he
was at the Fair, reporting for a
newspaper."</p>

<p>"That explains his glibness.
Don't have anything to do with
him, Mary. He's just trying to
draw you on. The burnt dog
should dread the fire."</p>

<p>"But he admires me, don't
he?"</p>

<p>"He says so, but he is much
more anxious that you should
admire him. Why, it's part of his
business to keep his hand in by
being in love, or rather by having
some silly little fool of a girl in
love with him. You'll just get
left again if you encourage this
young scamp."</p>

<p>April showers once more.</p>

<p>"I think the best thing I can
do is to jump overboard here into
Lake Michigan. It don't seem to
me I'm wanted anywheres."</p>

<p>"That might do very well, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
you're too good a swimmer to
drown easily, and you'd catch on
to my boat and upset me. I can't
swim a stroke, and there'd be
five&mdash;six young Gemmells and a
widow and a mother cast upon the
world. No, we'll have to think of
something better than that."</p>

<p>Mary's laughter was always
quick an the heels of her tears.</p>

<p>"What do you think I'm good
for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I can testify that you're not a
success as a housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Nor a nursemaid."</p>

<p>"And as a lady's companion
you're not all that could be desired,
even if there were a demand
for the article in West Michigan."</p>

<p>"As a gentleman's companion
I am all right," and the girl
showed her perfect teeth in a
smile.</p>

<p>"It's no joking matter, Mary.
You're not very happy in our
house, and things will be worse
for you next winter, with no Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Axworthy coming to see you, and
no engagement to him in prospect.
What do you think yourself that
you're fit for&mdash;putting reciting
and cornet playing out of the
question?"</p>

<p>The young lady rested her chin
on the palm of her hand and
composed her face into a bewitching
expression of profound meditation.</p>

<p>"I can't teach, and I can't sew,
and I can't cook. I couldn't
bear sitting still all day at a typewriter,
and there's no room in the
telephone office. You know
quite well that there aint a thing
for girls like me to do but to get
married. That's why God made
us pretty, so's we'd have a good
chance."</p>

<p>"Don't be flippant, miss. How
do you think you'd like to be an
hospital nurse?"</p>

<p>"I dunno; I wouldn't mind
trying. I'm generally good to
folks&mdash;when they're sick&mdash;and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
aint a bit scared of dirty nor of
dead ones. I laid out an old
woman that died in the Refuge."</p>

<p>"You're not particularly thin-skinned,
that's a fact; but it's the
educational qualification I'd be
afraid of. There's some sort of
an examination to be passed
before you can get into any of
these Training Schools nowadays.
I'll write for some forms of application,
and we'll see. If once
you were able to support yourself,
you'd think very differently
about marrying anybody that
turned up, just for the sake of a
home. Ours mayn't be much of
a one for you, but marry to get
out of it, and you'll perhaps find
yourself out of the frying-pan into
the fire."</p>

<p>"I think it would be just lovely
to be a nurse! There was one
came down from Chicago when
Mrs. Wade was sick, and the uniform
was awfully pretty. I'm
sure it would suit me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be very becoming, I
haven't any doubt of that; and
when it's all settled that you are
going to an hospital you can
write in reply to Will Axworthy's
last letter."</p>

<p>"He wanted me to keep on
writing to him just the same; said
he'd like always to be good friends
with me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't write him but once
again, and do it all by yourself.
Just say that the reason you
wrote the other letter, asking how
you stood with him, was that you
had been thinking of leaving us
altogether, but before taking the
decided step of entering an hospital,
you had thought it only
fair to him to give him the chance
to object, if he really had the
objections he had led you to
take for granted."</p>

<p>We heard a shouting and a
blowing of tin horns upon the
beach at this juncture. I took
the oars and pulled in, seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Belle and the boys waving their
hats in the bright moonlight.
My wife's face expressed the
blankest astonishment when she
saw who was my shipmate.</p>

<p>"We thought you must have
fallen asleep out there. Didn't
know you had company!"</p>

<p>Mary was still in the black
books when I came down the next
Saturday. Belle had a bitter
complaint.</p>

<p>"She sat there the whole afternoon
yesterday and part of the
evening, writing and rewriting a
letter before my very eyes. 'Are
you replying to Will Axworthy?'
I asked quite cordially, for I did
want to have a hand in answering
that letter&mdash;had some cutting
sentences all ready for him.
'Yes, mawm,' said she very
shortly; 'but I guess I can manage
to get along by myself.'"</p>

<p>I did not dare own up to the
advice I had given, but I saw that
matters must be hastened. Hav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ing
business in Chicago about that
time, I visited almost every hospital
in the city, telling Mary's story
in my most dramatic newspaper
style. I made it understood that
it was very noble and self-sacrificing
of the young woman, when
she might live in the lap of
luxury,&mdash;for thus did I unblushingly
describe my own modest
establishment,&mdash;to embrace a
nurse's vocation and labor for the
good of humanity, including herself,
of course. The education&mdash;or
the lack of it&mdash;was the drawback
everywhere, and also the
youth of the applicant, twenty-five
being a more acceptable age
than barely twenty-one.</p>

<p>But my perseverance was at last
rewarded by finding the superintendent
of a training school who
still had some imagination left,
and who became deeply interested
in Mary's "tale of woe."</p>

<p>"Make her study her reading,
spelling, and arithmetic as hard as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
she can for the next few months,
and I'll get her in the very first
opening."</p>

<p>The prospect roused Belle's old-time
vigor, and she had spelling
matches for Mary's benefit, made
the girl read aloud to her, gave
her dictation to write, and heard
her the multiplication tables every
forenoon&mdash;when she did not forget.</p>

<p>One delightful morning in
October I had the honor of taking
our <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> into Chicago and
delivering her up to the lady
superintendent. If she could only
stand the month of probation, we
flattered ourselves that she would
be safe.</p>

<p>Three weeks later I met the
Rev. Mr. Armstrong on the street.</p>

<p>"I think it is only right to tell
you what people are saying,"
said he.</p>

<p>"It's my business to know," I
replied.</p>

<p>"I mean about your adopted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
daughter. I have just been told
by two reputable parties, one after
the other, that she has been dismissed
from the hospital for flirting,
and that you and Mrs. Gemmell
are hushing the matter up as
well as you can, but that you don't
know at all where she is."</p>

<p>When I reached home my first
question was:</p>

<p>"Have you heard from Mary
lately, Belle?"</p>

<p>"Not for a week, and I'm quite
worried about her. Before that,
she wrote to me dutifully every
two or three days, telling me all
about her work. I've kept on
writing to her just the same,
making excuses for her to herself,
and never doubting her for a
minute; but to tell you the truth,
Dave, I'm getting dreadfully anxious."</p>

<p>Then I told her what I had
heard.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it, David!
I never shall till I hear it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
herself. I know now for a
certainty that I love that girl!
I'll believe her before all the
world! I'll stick by her through
thick and thin! I'll not insult
her by writing to the Hospital!
What now matters the little inconveniences
of living with her?
What have a few clothes and
toilet articles, more or less, to do
with it? If she has failed, she
shall come <i>home</i>, and we'll begin
the three years' fight all over
again. I'll sit down now and
write her the nicest letter I can
write."</p>

<p>That sounded very brave, but
inwardly I knew that my wife
suffered agonies the next few
days.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I had done this,"
she would say, "or if I had done
that&mdash;it seems precisely like a
death, and I've killed her."</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, two letters
came from Mary. They were
hurriedly and excitedly written.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear good mother, I am
accepted! It is the happiest day
of my life; it will be a red letter
day for you! I love you. I have
tried so hard for your sake; I
have tried to make my life hear
one long prayer and the dear
Lord helps me. I did not write
because the exam. was delaid, and
I wanted to wait untill I had
something <i>good</i> to tell you. I
look nice in the unniform. It is
pink and a white cap, apron and
cuffs. Oh I am so contented;
this work is so filling. I never
get lonely or homesick. <i>We</i>
nurses had a party, and we danced
and served ice cream, and there
was some lovely doctors here,
and the Princippal is so kind to
us we have lots of fun"&mdash;and so
the letters ran on.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The reaction was too much
for Belle. She cried, then she
laughed, then she fell on her knees
and thanked God, and she told me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
she added that, for pity's sake, He
<i>must</i> set His angels to guard
Mary, for she was a poor, frail
child, who had got lost in coming
this time, and many persecuted
her because she was pretty, and
might find a resting place and get
a little of what rightfully (?) belonged
to them.</p>

<p>After a while she went down
to see Mr. Armstrong, and read
him the letters. He turned very
white.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pity of it!" said he.</p>

<p>"I wish I could gather her
slanderers into one room and read
them these letters," said Belle.</p>

<p>For days afterward she button-holed
people in the street to tell
them about Mary, or to read them
scraps of her letters. If they had
said she was vain and idle, and
selfish and incompetent, just like
the half of their own daughters,
Belle could have forgiven them.
It was their determination
to shove her into the gutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which made my wife her valiant
champion.</p>

<p>"Whatever that girl amounts
to, Dave, will be born of our faith
in her, and we must never go back
on her. She writes me that whenever
she has a hard task, such as
attending fits, there I stand at her
back and help."</p>

<p>"Just between ourselves,
though, you must confess that it
is a great relief to have her
away."</p>

<p>"You can't begin to feel that
as I do. I live again! I read
my own books, think my own
thoughts. I belong to myself.
No one says, 'What's the
matter?' 'Where are you going?'
'What makes you grave&mdash;or
gay?' I sit and chat with my
'odd-fish.' I go to all kinds of
meetings and discuss all kinds of
'isms, and have no tag-tail constantly
asking 'Why?' 'Why?'
or 'Tell me!' It's the little
things that grind. The next time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
I try to help a young girl, I'll not
risk losing my influence with her
by taking her into my house. Do
you know, Dave, I sometimes feel
that Mary must have been my
own child in a previous incarnation,
and I neglected and abused
her; that's why she was thrust
back upon me this time, whether I
liked it or not."</p>

<p>After Christmas Isabel decided
that she must go up to Chicago
to see Mary, and on her return
thrilling was the account she gave
of her experiences, which included
an attendance at an autopsy&mdash;but
upon that I shall not enlarge.</p>

<p>Introducing herself to the
Superintendent of the School,
she said:</p>

<p>"Can I have Miss Gemmell for
two days at my hotel?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, madam. We are
short of help, and it would be
entirely against the rules."</p>

<p>"Then I'll stay here with
her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lady Superintendent
looked distressed.</p>

<p>"Don't think us inhospitable,
but there is absolutely no provision
for guests in all this great
building."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Belle, unabashed.
"I seem to be unfortunate in
breaking, or wanting to break, the
rules of this house. Now, will
you kindly tell me what I can do?
How can I see the very most of
my Mary while I am in Chicago?"</p>

<p>After some thought the answer
came:</p>

<p>"You may have Miss Gemmell
to-morrow afternoon, and two
hours on Sunday."</p>

<p>"That will not suit me at all!
Now, please forget all that has
been said, and I will tell you that
I Mrs. David Gemmell of Lake
City, Michigan, am a poor tired
woman, threatened with nervous
prostration, have already chills of
apprehension running down my
back, coupled with flushes of ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>pectation
to my head." By this
time Mary, the Lady Superintendent,
and two other nurses
present were all attention, and
Belle added gravely:</p>

<p>"I want one of your best private
rooms on Corridor B, where
Miss Gemmell is on duty, and I
should like to see the House Surgeon
at once."</p>

<p>So Belle was comfortably and
luxuriously established in the
hospital, and the only drawback
was that she had to be served
with her meals in her room.</p>

<p>"What feasts we had&mdash;Mary
and I," she said. "What fun!
Before I left I had demoralized
that whole hospital staff, and
broken every rule in the institution.
It did them all good."</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't been indiscreet,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Indiscreet?"</p>

<p>"You must remember that Mary
braced herself up to go to the
hospital when she was 'out' with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
you. Now you've gone and made
so much of her that she'll think,
whenever things become too hot
for her, she has only to march
straight back here again."</p>

<p>"She assures me she <i>will</i>
graduate."</p>

<p>"There should never be any
question of that."</p>

<p>"David, I've only told you the
one side. If that girl were my
very own I should pluck her out
of that particular fire. I'd get
down on my knees and beg her
pardon for having thrown her
into it. It burns up their youth,
their bloom, their originality, their
modesty. It thrusts the girls into
a charnel house of sin, sickness,
and death. It shatters the nervous
system of nine out of ten, or
it leaves them calm, steady, burnt-out
women, who have been behind
the scenes of life and are disillusioned.
When that little pink
and white thing sat there and
told me of some of the awful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
situations that she'd been placed
in, and over which she was made
responsible, the tears rolled down
my face. I forgave her lots of
things."</p>

<p>"Plenty of refined, educated
women with a very different bringing
up from Mary's go through
the same."</p>

<p>"Well, I advised her to go on
and finish the course, if only to
show her friends, and enemies,
the stuff she's made of. When I
think of those free wards, and the
menial, disgusting offices that frail
little girl has to perform! What
did she sow that she should reap
this fighting in the thickest of the
fight, so poorly equipped?"</p>

<p>"I dare say there are alleviations."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! She flirts&mdash;says she'd
die if she didn't&mdash;with every man
in the place, from the elevator
boy to the head doctor, and,
really, I excused her. The head
nurse in Mary's ward is very harsh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with her, but I let her and everyone
in the place understand that
Miss Gemmell is no stray waif
without influence to back her.
Every day I send out thought-waves&mdash;hypnotism&mdash;whatever
you
like to call it&mdash;to compel that
Dean woman to think of something
else than the making of
trained nurses, and physical wrecks
at the same time. People are
greater than institutions."</p>

<p>"The discipline will be the
making of Mary."</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">D</span>uring</span> the famous
Pullman strike of last
summer, duty bade me
cross to Chicago in the
interests of the <i>Echo</i>.
On Saturday afternoon, July the
7th, I was at the pulse of the
Anarchist movement, near the
corner of Loomis and Forty-ninth
Streets. Taking up my stand in
the deep entry of a "House to
Let," I watched the operations of
a body of strikers gathered round
a box car close to the Grand Trunk
crossing. They had set it afire,
and were trying to overturn it
upon the railway track, encouraged
by the cheers of a mob
numbering about two thousand
men, women, and children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The incendiaries were so much
engrossed that they did not observe,
backing swiftly down upon
them, the wrecking train it was
their purpose to block. While
still in motion, the cars disgorged
Captain Kelly and his company,
who had been guarding the Pan
Handle tracks all day, but had
not yet, it seemed, earned their
night's repose.</p>

<p>The crowd greeted the soldiers
with stones, brickbats, and pieces
of old iron, but the car burners
proceeded with their little job,
paying no attention at all to the
approach of the military.</p>

<p>A pistol bullet out of the mob
swished in among his men, and
then Captain Kelly gave the order
to fire. When the smoke of the
volley cleared away, I saw the
people stand still, shocked and
dumb with surprise. A second
later, realizing that the worm had
had the audacity to turn, they
vented a medley of shrieks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
roars, and closed round the handful
of soldiers, to be met by the
points of bayonets.</p>

<p>The yelling mass of humanity
scattered, took refuge in lanes
and houses, but regaining courage,
appeared here and there in
sections, to be assailed once more
by soldiers and police. The latter
had to fight it out by themselves
after a while, for the military
boarded the wrecking train again,
and the engineer, completely
"rattled," opened the throttle,
and whisked them away to the
West, leaving a dozen revolver-armed
policemen to meet the
assaults of a mob that had now
increased to five thousand.</p>

<p>The Press abuses the police on
principle, but, seeing that heroic encounter,
I wavered in the keeping
of my promise to Belle not to run
into danger. Even as I hesitated,
"hurry-up wagons" arrived with
re-enforcements from neighboring
police stations, and then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
crowd could not disperse quickly
enough. It was a desperate
sight&mdash;men knocking each other
down in their haste to get away,
and the women who had been
spurring them on, now shrieking
and groaning like maniacs. One
of the poor creatures was hit on
the ankle by a bullet, and her
falling over into the gutter was
too much for my virtuous resolution.
Even if she is a dirty, howling
Polack, a man does not enjoy
seeing a woman knocked down,
so I left my doorstep and went to
help the lady up. Constitutionally
I am not a brave man, but I
forgot all about the flying bullets
till one took me in the knee,
and I toppled over, hitting my
head against the curbstone as
I did so. I must have been
stunned, for when I opened my
eyes again the street was empty,
except for a thundering vehicle
that was bearing straight down
upon me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>At first I thought it was a runaway,
for the horse was foaming
of mouth and bloodshot of eyeball;
but no, there was a man, or
fiend, with a similar wild gleam in
his eye, urging the brute upon
me, while he sounded a gong to
keep everything out of his way.
All this I saw in a flash, and in a
flash too went through my mind
the advice given by President
Cleveland in his proclamation to
non-combatants to keep out of
harm's way.</p>

<p>I rolled over on my side with
the sickening certainty that the
next instant the hoofs and the
wheels would be upon me, but the
horse pulled up on his haunches
at my very feet, the rattle and
clanging ceased, and a doctor in
his shirt sleeves appeared as if by
magic.</p>

<p>It was an ambulance, of course.</p>

<p>I fainted when they lifted me,
and only came to myself in the
hospital&mdash;Mary's hospital, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ward. Every one in Chicago was
crowded that week and the next,
but&mdash;the ruling principle strong
in death&mdash;I declined to be put
away out of eyeshot and earshot
into a private room.</p>

<p>"D'ye want me to send word to
Mis' Gemmell to come?" asked
Mary, and I replied drowsily:</p>

<p>"No, don't. She's better to
keep out of harm's way. She
would be sure to sympathize with
the strikers."</p>

<p>"But she'll wonder where you
are."</p>

<p>"She can't get here safely, as
things are now, and the mails are
all upset. Don't write. Send a
telegram in my name. Date it
Chicago, and tell her I'm detained,
but that I'll go home Monday,
sure."</p>

<p>That same night I was off in a
high fever. It was days and days
before I came to myself, and then
I was too weak to ask or to care
how everything was going on at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
home. My whole interest in life
was concentrated upon that hospital
ward, and with half-closed eyes
I lay there and took notes unconsciously.</p>

<p>An ideal life it may seem to
outsiders, but there is as much
wire-pulling, as much jealousy
and scandal within the walls of
one of those big institutions, as
anywhere else on this planet. It
is an epitome of the world battle,
and the strugglers meet in hand-to-hand
conflict.</p>

<p>Nurse Dean, the head of our
ward, tall and angular in form,
stern and cold in feature, was the
dragon Belle had told me about,
but she knew her business, and I,
for one, preferred that she should
regard me simply as a machine
laid up for repairs. I did not even
think her unduly severe upon
Mary, after I heard her giving that
damsel "Hail Columbia" for her
carelessness in having administered
the wrong medicine one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
whole forenoon to Number Nine&mdash;which
was myself.</p>

<p>If I had not made a feeble protest
in her favor, "Nurse Gemmell"
would have been discharged
on the spot.</p>

<p>I do not wish to leave the impression
that Mary had not in
her the making of a fairly good
nurse. She was light of foot, as
well as quick of hand, and I liked
to have her do things for me;
found her <i>aura</i> agreeable, as
Belle would have expressed it.
Like many half-educated people,
she was very observant, but, so
far as I could judge, she had one
eye on her work and the other on
the lookout for flirtations. I became
quite interested in some of
them.</p>

<p>There was the German fiddler
in the next bed to mine, who
could not keep his eyes off Mary
whenever she came into the ward,
and once when Nurse Dean was
off duty, and she brought out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her silver-plated cornet to "toot"
a little for him, he declared it was
the most ravishing music he had
ever heard in his life!</p>

<p>I strongly suspected that the
limp young artisan on the other
side of me was perfectly well
enough to be discharged, but he
could not brace himself up to
part from Mary. Then there was
a young doctor whose face I
dimly recognized, but it tired my
poor head too much to try to
think who he was. He and Mary
had many a talk at my bedside
about their own affairs. One
evening I heard the unmistakable
sound of a banjo, and managed
to twist myself round far enough
to see that this same doctor was
playing an accompaniment to
Mary's very fair imitation of a
skirt dance out in the passage.</p>

<p>The sight revived me so much
that I laughed aloud, and Mary
came hastily forward, blushing,
with finger on her lip. The pink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and white uniform did indeed
become her wonderfully well, and
I was not surprised to notice
hearty admiration in the sleepy
blue eyes of the young house
surgeon. Where had I seen that
"Burne Jones' head" before?</p>

<p>"You don't seem to remember
me, Mr. Gemmell," said the owner
of it, holding out his hand. "My
name's Flaker. I was at Interlaken
summer before last."</p>

<p>"You're a full-fledged M. D.
now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I'm taking a
year's practice in here, before I
set up for myself."</p>

<p>Shades of the hotel matrons!
They would probably say, if they
heard this, that Mary had been
sent here on purpose to catch him.</p>

<p>Poor Mary! She had her own
row to hoe. She came to me in
tears one evening because Nurse
Dean had been after her that
whole day about one thing or
another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am never particular 'nough
to please her. If it wasn't for
Dr. Flaker I wouldn't stay here
another day."</p>

<p>"You like him pretty well,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Well enough, an' he's all
broke up on me; says he was at
Interlaken too, on'y he couldn't
say anythin', 'cause he wasn't of
age. His folks are awful high-toned."</p>

<p>"They'll have their discipline,"
thought I.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mary, how long
is it since I was brought here?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks to-day."</p>

<p>I sprang almost out of bed in
my surprise. "Why didn't you
tell me? Has no word been sent
to Lake City?"</p>

<p>"None since that first telegram.
I don't write very often now to
your wife, but when I did, I
never said nothin' 'tall about
your bein' here, 'cause you told
me not to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"And haven't you had an
answer?"</p>

<p>"There's a letter lyin' there
from Mis' Gemmell to you. I
don't know how she could have
found out your address. Nurse
Dean said I wasn't to give it to
you if you was a bit feverish."</p>

<p>"Fetch it this minute, Mary, or
I'll get up and walk the floor,"
and the girl brought me this
remarkable document. It had
neither beginning nor end, but
rushed to the point at once.</p>

<p>"I know all! You have
laughed at my occult tendencies,
sneered at my Theosophy, but I
can now, alas! give you convincing
proof of the penetrative power
of the one, the sustaining power
of the other. I became so nervous
at your continued silence and
absence that I did what I had
promised you not to do&mdash;went out
in my astral to hunt for you&mdash;and
I found you! Would to God I
had never tried! It is not my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
health that is ruined, but my
heart and my happiness. To
make assurance doubly sure, I
psychometrized the only letter I
have received from Mary in weeks.
She was cunning enough not to
mention your name, but the unspoken
testimony was the same.
To think that you of all men&mdash;but
I do not blame you! I have
gone down to the <i>Echo</i> office, my
heart bursting with despair, and
have told lies to account for your
absence, to keep things moving
until you see fit to send your own
explanation. I have thrown dust
too in the eyes of the family, till
you tell me your will concerning
them. No, I dare not blame you!
Did not I myself thrust the girl
into your life&mdash;and the best of us
are but human. It is Karma! I
have deserved this blow for some
previous sin of my own, and I bow
my head to the stroke. Your own
harvest will be just as certain,
however long delayed. O David,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
David! I can look back now and
see the very beginning of your
interest in Mary&mdash;but that it
should end in this&mdash;that you
should fly from me to her&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Having read so far, I burst into
hysterical laughter, and it took
Mary and her lover and Nurse
Dean, and how many more I know
not, to hold me in bed. Of course
I had a relapse, and my life was
despaired of, but I would not, in
my sensible moments, allow Mary
to write to, or send for Isabel. I
pictured the streets still full of
rioting strikers, and the mails
and trains still disorganized. In
waking and in delirium alike,
"Keep her out of harm's way!"
I cried, "I'll go home to-morrow,
sure," but it was a long to-morrow
that saw me on the boat bound
for Lake City.</p>

<p>Mary wanted to accompany me,
for I was still very weak, and had
to walk with a stick on account of
my knee, but I said brusquely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
"You stay where you are, and
keep an eye on Dr. Flaker, or
you'll maybe get left again."</p>

<p>"No fear of that!" she said,
holding up her left hand to show
me a broad gold band with five
diamonds in it, adorning her third
finger.</p>

<p>"We'll be married as soon as
his year is out, for he has plenty
of money."</p>

<p>The stones in her ring caught
the evening sunlight as she stood
on the wharf waving her handkerchief
to me, while the boat moved
slowly out, and I lay in a steamer
chair on the hurricane deck, prepared
to enjoy a smoke and a
gossip with my old friend, the
captain.</p>

<p>I wished her well with all
my heart, but I sincerely hoped
that I had seen the last of
Mary.</p>

<p>Judging the family to be at
Interlaken as usual, I took the
first train down there, and toiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in the sun from the depot up to
the cottages, by way of the hill,
which I had never considered
steep before, to find my own
house deserted, windows and
doors boarded up, veranda unswept,
hammocks removed. I
would not give any of the neighbors
the satisfaction of knowing I
was surprised and disappointed,
so I kept out of sight till they
had all been to the hotel for dinner
and dispersed. Then I went
in for mine, and after it returned
to the beach near the station, lay
down on the sand, and waited for
the next train.</p>

<p>There was not one back to
town until late in the afternoon,
and the evening being cloudy, it
was quite dark by the time I left
the electric car at the corner of
our street. Even that little bit of
a walk exhausted me, and I had
to rest on my stick every few
minutes, but what a relief it was
to see, gleaming cheerfully as ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the windows of the House of the
Seven Gables.</p>

<p>I leaned against our iron railing
for a minute or two to collect myself
before making my appearance,
and highly necessary was it
for me to do so, because the attitude
of the two ladies upon the
veranda struck me dumb with
amazement, and their conversation
completely floored me. That
sandy-haired little woman in the
low rocker must be my mother,
but could that regal figure on the
edge of the veranda, with her
head in my mother's lap, possibly
be my wife? The light from the
nursery window showed them to
me distinctly, but I kept back in
the shadow and listened to the
voices.</p>

<p>"My puir lamb! Ye've grat
eneugh! Gang awa' tae yer bed;
ye're sair forfoughten."</p>

<p>As she stroked the wavy gray
hair of the head on her knee, her
tone changed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I canna thole to think 'at son
o' mine has brocht a' this trouble
upon ye."</p>

<p>"Not a word against him,
mother! He's the best man that
ever lived, and I didn't appreciate
him, that's all. I can never think
of him but as my dear, old, solid,
yours-to-count-on Dave Gemmell.
He was the silent partner, unpopular,
getting no praise, paying all
bills, backing me up in every fad,
whether his judgment approved
or not. He was just the square
foundation I could lean away out
on&mdash;could dance jigs on if I
wanted to. Now that he is dead&mdash;or
dead to me&mdash;I can only hope
that he is happy. Oh! if I had
but listened to you, mother, had
never brought that girl into the
house. My own vineyard have I
not kept."</p>

<p>"Let by-ganes be by-ganes&mdash;but
I wad jest like to hae Davvit
by the lug."</p>

<p>"Lug along, mother! Here I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
am!" I managed to shout, and
then I hung over that fence and
laughed till my specs dropped off
in the grass, and my stick fell
away from me. I could not move
without it, so I had to wait till
the two women took pity on me
and released me from my impalement.</p>

<p>Between them they got me into
the house and on to my old sofa,
and listened to what I had to say.</p>

<p>"I was share there must be
some mistak'," said my mother,
her self-respect restored, but, when
I saw how affectionately her hand
rested on the bowed head of her
weeping daughter-in-law, I did not
regret the bullet in my knee.</p>

<p>"We'll put it all down to your
Theosophy, Belle&mdash;a collection of
half-truths, more dangerous than
lies, when you shove them too
far."</p>

<p>"Don't let us talk about that
now, David. It breaks my heart
to see you so thin. Your clothes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are just hanging on you. Oh! if
I had only known the true state
of the case and been there to
nurse you!"</p>

<p>"Mary has been very good to
me, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to think about
that girl any more. I'm glad she's
all right, but I hope never to lay
eyes on her again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she's all right, and
when she marries Dr. Flaker
she won't want to '<i>pa</i>pa' and
'<i>mam</i>ma' us, though she may
condescend to patronize us a
little."</p>

<p>"I'll be gled o' the day she
draps the name o' Gemmell!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My wife is still a theosophist.
If it pleases her to think that she
has ascertained the nature and
method of existence, I have nothing
to say. Sometimes I even
look with envy upon her cheerful
attitude toward the approach of
old age, her conviction that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
are to have another chance&mdash;many
more chances&mdash;to do and to be
that which we have failed in doing
and being, <i>this time</i>.</p>

<p>To judge of a tree by its fruits,
there is, of course, no doubt that

her Theosophy, has been</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="hidden">N</span>urse Dean</span> walked
through the Pest House,
adjoining the great
hospital, with the independent
mien of the
woman who is confident that her
skirt clears the ground. Her
keen, light-colored eyes took in at
a glance the condition of every
patient, the occupation of every
nurse.</p>

<p>There had been a smallpox
epidemic in Chicago, and three of
the nurses in &mdash;&mdash; Hospital had
taken the disease, two of them
lightly, one very heavily; but all
were now convalescent. The two
had gone home to their friends to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
recruit, but the third lay in an
invalid chair in a darkened room,
looking as if the desire of life had
left her. Nurse Dean came in
with a cheery smile, put on just
outside the door, and proceeded
to bathe the girl's eyes with warm
water.</p>

<p>"When are you coming out to
help me, Mary? I'm sure the
light wouldn't hurt you now. I'm
having too much night work,
those other nurses being gone.
I thought you might begin to
ease me a little with the smallpox
patients through the day."</p>

<p>"I don't know as I care to go
on with the business," replied
Mary, sometime called Mason.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You're low-spirited
just now because you're
not quite better, but wait till
you're on your feet and going
around the wards again. There's
nothing like work of this sort
to make a person forget herself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Nurse Dean's strong but gentle
hands began to rub with
oil the patient's neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>"I wish I could forget myself
and everybody else too. I wish I
had died of the smallpox. There
aint anybody that cares whether
I live or die."</p>

<p>"Hush! Mary, you forget Dr.
Flaker."</p>

<p>"Aint it just him I'm thinkin'
about? He came in to see me
to-day for the first time. He
hates smallpox, and he smelt so
of iodoform he nearly made me
sick. About all he had to say
was that it was very foolish of me
to meddle with the clothes of
them patients, and he could
hardly believe I was so crazy's
not to be vaccinated when the
other nurses were. Just as if it
wasn't him that admired my
lovely arms. Look at them
now!"</p>

<p>"They won't be so bad when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
all these scales are off. There!
Doesn't that feel better?"</p>

<p>"It feels all right enough, but
you know I'll be a sight to be
seen the rest of my days. I was
glad the room was dark, so's
Flaker couldn't get a good look
at me. He'll know soon enough&mdash;and
hate the sight of me. He
was always so proud of my 'pearance."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure he likes you for
something else too, Mary."</p>

<p>"I don't care whether he does
or not, he's got to marry me just
the same. I aint goin' to be left
again," and the girl tried to make
a blazing diamond ring keep in
place upon her thin finger.</p>

<p>"You love him very much?"</p>

<p>"Don't know as I do&mdash;no more
than lots of other fellows; but I
won't have any more chances
now. I didn't ask to be born into
this world, and somebody in it
owes me a living."</p>

<p>"See here, Mary!" said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
nurse, in a suddenly energetic
tone that made the girl look up
at her with startled eyes. "You
know, as well as I do, that you
can't make that man marry you.
Why not give him back his ring
of your own free will?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? You think I
aint in love?"</p>

<p>"Love? You don't know what
the word means in any but its
very lowest sense. Suppose you
stop loving men, and take to loving
women and children; you'll
find them much more grateful, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>Mary closed her eyes, but there
were no eyelashes to keep the
tears from trickling out upon the
scarred face.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" said Nurse
Dean, in a voice hardly recognizable,
it was so sympathetic,
"you've been fighting for yourself
ever since you can remember, and
you haven't made much of it,
have you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl's lips shaped an inaudible
"No."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good idea,
then, to try a little fighting for
other people?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any folks."</p>

<p>"Your 'folks' are whoever you
can help in any way. What have
you done yet to deserve a foothold
on this earth? Instead of
seeing how much you can get
out of everybody, turn round and
see how much you can do for
them."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was a long silence.
When Nurse Dean thought her
charge was falling asleep, she
placed a shawl carefully over her,
but Mary, without opening her
eyes, drew something from her
left hand to her right.</p>

<p>"You can give him back his
ring," she said.</p>

<p>Nurse Dean closed the door
softly behind her, and then
paused for a moment to wipe an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
impertinent tear from her cold
gray eye.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be at all surprised
if the smallpox were just The
Making of Mary."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
